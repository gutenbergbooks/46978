</div>

<div>
  <h2 id='ch01' class='c008'>I<br /> <br />Aunt Cal</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>“But</span> this aunt of yours, Sandy, what’s she like?”
Eve asked. She was parked on the couch in my
room. Hattie May Lewis, my roommate, stood
before the mirror, trying to arrange her straight, straw-colored
hair into a windblown bob. It was the week
before the closing of school for the summer vacation
and we were all looking ahead, in one way or another,
to what the next three months held in store for us.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well,” I considered, “I don’t honestly know much
about Aunt Cal except the little Dad has told me. She’s
an aunt by marriage, you know. She married my
mother’s brother, my Uncle Tom Poole, he was. They
went West to live for a time, but after Uncle Tom died
she came back to Fishers Haven. She’s lived alone there
ever since.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Narrow!” ejaculated Hattie May, “and very likely
queer besides! You can depend upon it. I know how
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>old women get who live alone in the country.” Saying
what she thought about people, whether they were
present or not, was part of what Hattie May called
her code of speaking the truth.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, perhaps,” I admitted. “But she’s not so very
old.” I felt slightly annoyed with Hattie May and
wished she would go downstairs. I was anxious for a
very special reason to make Aunt Cal seem attractive
to the girl on the couch. For though Hattie May had
been my roommate this first year at school, it was
Eve Fordyce’s opinions on most subjects which had
come to matter.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Hattie May showed no inclination to depart, so
I went on. “Perhaps you’d like to hear what Dad says
about her,” I suggested. I reached into a pigeon-hole in
my desk and took out a thin paper envelope with a
foreign stamp. My father is a missionary in China, you
see, and that’s why the long vacation didn’t mean to
me quite what it did to the other girls. It meant a
summer spent with some one of a rather scattered collection
of relatives, none of whom I remembered in the
least. This summer it was to mean Aunt Cal.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes; let’s hear it.” Eve smiled encouragingly
from the cushions. I suppose she saw how in earnest I
was.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your Aunt Calliope,” Dad wrote, “is in many ways
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>a remarkable woman and I feel that you cannot but
profit by her acquaintance. It is, however, not entirely
on your own account that I have suggested this visit. I am
hoping that she in turn may reap some benefit from
your stay with her. I must confess that the occasional
letters which we have had from her within the last
few years have reflected a certain melancholy trend of
thought which has given me some concern. So I am
hoping, my dear daughter, that you will bring her
something of your own happy——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, that’s about all,” I broke off because of that
sudden chokiness that comes over me still at times, even
though ten whole months have gone by since I said
good-bye to Mother and Dad on the dock at Shanghai.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’d I tell you!” exclaimed Hattie May triumphantly.
“Queer! Queer and brooding! Honest,
Sandy, I can’t say I envy you your summer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I don’t know,” Eve drawled. “I think she sounds
rather interesting. And I don’t think she necessarily
has to be narrow because she’s lived in a New England
village most of her life. As for being queer—well, everybody
is a little, aren’t they?”</p>

<p class='c010'>I threw her a grateful glance. “Maybe you’d like to
hear her letter, too,” I said on a sudden impulse. “It just
came today. Of course it doesn’t say much,” I added, a
little doubtful, on second thought, of the wisdom of
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>revealing Aunt Cal any further with Hattie May in the
room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll bet it says plenty!” Hattie May swung round.
Her small bright eyes fairly pounced on the letter as I
pulled it from its envelope. “You can tell a lot by handwriting
and—well, reading between the lines.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s nothing written between the lines,” I said,
though I knew, of course, what she was driving at. The
letter was written in a straight, angular hand and was
very short.</p>

<p class='c011'>My Dear Niece: I have received your father’s
letter and shall be very pleased to welcome you to
my home at any time. I live very plain. Your father
speaks of your bringing one of your schoolmates
with you to keep you company. I don’t suppose two
will be much more trouble than one.</p>

<div class='c012'>Your affectionate aunt, &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div class='c012'>Calliope Poole</div>

<p class='c013'>As I finished reading, I saw that Hattie May had
sunk into the Morris chair and was fanning herself
violently with a copy of “Queens of the Screen.” Staging
mock fainting fits is one of her pet stunts.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course,” I said apologetically, “she didn’t realize
quite how that last sentence would sound.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, written things often sound quite different than
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>one means them,” agreed Eve comfortably.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hattie May came to life. “<i>What</i> did you say her
first name was—I didn’t seem to get it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Calliope,” I repeated. “Dad said her mother was sort
of romantic when she was young, read poetry a lot and
all that. Calliope was a Muse of poetry, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hattie May giggled. “It does amuse all right,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>I ignored this. I felt that it was now or never with
me. That the moment had come to speak of the all
important matter with which, ever since the arrival
of Aunt Cal’s letter, my heart had been bursting. If by
any wild miracle, I could persuade Eve Fordyce to go
to Fishers Haven with me, half the battle would be
over. I felt that I could bear any number of dour-faced
relatives with Eve along. But what would she think
of such an invitation? It didn’t promise much for a
clever girl like Eve.</p>

<p class='c010'>I was trying desperately to think how to begin when
Eve herself took the words out of my mouth. “Well,
darling, who are you going to take along with you on
your mission of cheer?”</p>

<p class='c010'>I plunged. “Why,” I began, “of course Hattie May
can’t go because her family expects her home and—well,
she wouldn’t care ’bout it anyway. But I thought,
maybe—that is, it just occurred to me because of your
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>mother’s being abroad and all—I wondered, that is—of
course it won’t be exciting or anything like a regular
seashore resort——.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sandra, darling,” Eve’s throaty voice broke into my
stumbling attempt, “are you trying to invite me to
spend the summer at the home of this estimable
woman, your aunt?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course she is,” said Hattie May. “But if you take
my advice——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve smiled her slow smile. “Hattie May,” she said,
“I wouldn’t turn down the chance of an adventure like
that for anything.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Eve, do you really mean it?” I cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Adventure!” snorted Hattie May. “Well, if you
call being buried alive an adventure——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve got lazily to her feet, wrapping her orange coolie
coat about her. “I’m going to write to Aunt Margery
right away,” she declared. “I’ll tell her about the wonderful
air and the simple, wholesome life at Fishers
Haven. She’ll eat that up!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Eve,” I gazed rapturously up at her, “that’s
perfectly wonderful of you. And I do hope—oh, I do—that
you won’t be sorry!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, all I’ve got to say,” declared Hattie May
stuffily, “is that I wish you both a pleasant summer, but
I’m mighty glad I’m not in your shoes!”</p>

shutters, set in tiny green yards. Eve said it was a picture
village out of a scouring powder advertisement.</p>

<p class='c010'>We were walking up from the bus stop. There was
no railroad in Fishers Haven. It seemed good to stretch
our legs after the all-day train ride. I was carrying my
suitcase, which was pretty heavy, but I didn’t mind.
The bus driver had directed us: “Turn the corner at
the drug store, it’s the third house.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There it was! White like the others, with a small
front yard, bordered on two sides by a neat hedge. A
brick walk led up to a narrow front stoop. Our eyes
were lifted anxiously to the door as we mounted the
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>steps. It had, I could not suppress the thought, a very
closed look. I lifted the knocker with some trepidation;
it seemed like an intrusion to make a noise in so silent
a place.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a feeble knock, but no sooner had it died away
when we heard a window raised above us and a voice
called, “Go round to the back and wipe your feet on
the mat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve giggled. How I loved her for it!</p>

<p class='c010'>The grass in the side yard had been freshly mowed
and smelled deliciously. “Syringas, too!” Eve inhaled
rapturously. “I’m going to sleep out in that lily-of-the-valley
bed,” she whispered, “and pretend I’m a
dryad!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hush! Here she is.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A small woman in a big white apron was standing
on the back porch. Her eyes were dark and very
bright, and her nose had a kind of pinched-in look as if
she were smelling of something. Her expression was—well,
speculative.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So here you are!” she said, holding out a bony,
work-worn hand. “I guess you’re Sandra. You’ve got
the Hutton nose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have I?” I laughed. And, moved by an impulse for
which I was quite unable to account, I stooped and
kissed her where her hair was parted flatly on her forehead.
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>“This is my best friend, Eve Fordyce,” I said
before she had recovered from her surprise at my salutation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve smiled devastatingly. “Pleased to meet you,” said
my relative.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was awfully sweet of you to let me come along
with Sandy,” Eve said. “I hope we aren’t going to be
a lot of bother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I guess everybody’s a bother when it comes
to that,” returned Aunt Cal not too ungraciously. “It’s
a good deal of bother to live anyway, what with three
meals a day winter and summer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you know I’ve often thought of that very thing
myself,” agreed Eve. “If it wasn’t for eating, what loads
of spare time we’d have to do a lot of extra exciting
things.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Cal looked as if precisely this view of the matter
had not occurred to her before. But all she said was,
“Come in, supper’s on the stove.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The kitchen was small and painfully neat; the same
scrubbed look was everywhere. We washed our hands
at the sink at Aunt Cal’s direction, as supper, she said,
had already stood about as long as it could, and sat
down at a blue and white oilcloth covered table. It was
a good supper, though plain, as Aunt Cal had warned
me. Baked beans, bread and butter, tea and applesauce.
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>Eve and I chattered about our trip, while Aunt Cal
drank strong tea and said little.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was nearly dark by the time we had finished eating
everything that was on the table. The noisily ticking
alarm clock on the kitchen shelf said ten minutes past
eight. “I expect you’ll want to go to bed early after
your long trip,” Aunt Cal remarked as she began to
clear the table. She took one of the shining glass lamps
from the shelf and, though it wasn’t yet dark enough
to light it, led the way upstairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is the spare room,” she said with some pride,
throwing open a door at the end of the short passage.
It was not large, but its prim, cool order presented so
pleasant a contrast to the clutter of departure that we
had left behind us that morning that we both heaved
an involuntary sight of relief. “Oh, it’s lovely,” Eve
breathed. “And that bed looks big enough for six
giants.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A faint look of dismay flitted across our hostess’ countenance
at the suggested picture. “I guess it’ll hold two
your size,” she said dryly. And added, “Breakfast’s at
seven sharp. Goodnight.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As the door closed, I sank weakly upon the bed. “I
feel somehow,” I said, “as if there’d been a death in
the family.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve laughed. And the familiar ring of it made the
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>strange room seem less strange. “Oh, Evey darling,” I
cried, “I’m so glad you’re here. Promise you won’t go
and walk out on me now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Heavens, no! Why should I? I think Aunt Cal is a
treasure—only she doesn’t know it. I’m going to pretend
she’s my aunt too. She’s so different from Aunt Margery,
and I think a variety in relations is very broadening. The
thing we’ve got to do, Sandy, is to make her glad we’re
here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose so,” I said. It was like Eve to look at things
that way. Well, maybe I’d feel more optimistic in the
morning, I thought. I found the key to my suitcase
and went to unpack.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bother this lock!” I exclaimed after a few minutes
of fumbling. “The key just won’t go in!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve, who had already finished emptying her bag
while I had been struggling, came over to help me.
“Why, Sandy,” she said, “this can’t be the key, it’s too
large.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, it’s the key I locked it with this morning,” I
retorted impatiently. “My trunk key is flat and I haven’t
any other.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve shook her head puzzled. “You’d better look
through your handbag anyway,” she said. “This simply
can’t be the key.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Just to satisfy her, I dumped the contents of my bag
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>on the blue and white counterpane of the bed. There
was the key to my trunk, half a bar of nut fudge wrapped
in tin foil and bearing unmistakable evidences of having
been sat on, my address book in which all the girls had
written their summer addresses just last night, a vanity
case, two rubber bands, a stub of a pencil, and a handkerchief.
That was all.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You see,” I said, “it’s just got to be the key. It can’t
be anything else.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then,” said Eve most surprisingly, “this isn’t your
suitcase!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What!” I wheeled about and looked at the case on
the chair. It was black and had once been shiny. It surely
looked like mine, scratches and all. But wait—what was
that gouge in the fabric near the hinge? I didn’t remember
that.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Eve did a funny thing. She leant over and
sniffed it. “Tobacco!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c010'>I went to sniff too; the odor was unmistakable. I took
the case up and felt its weight again. “I remember thinking
it was awfully heavy on the way from the station,”
I mused. I was looking the case over more carefully now
and the more I looked, the more unfamiliar it became.
Could it be possible that Eve was right and that somehow
or other I’d contrived to walk off with somebody
else’s baggage? I could not understand it.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>“But how could it have happened?” I cried. “I had
it with me all the way on the train and in the station
in Boston and on the bus after we left Berkshire
Plains.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve had dropped onto an old sea chest which stood
under the window. She seemed to be thinking deeply.
Finally her face lighted up. “I’ve got it!” she cried.
“’Member that little, bow-legged man in the funny
clothes who stopped the bus out in the country quite a
while after we left Berkshire Plains? It wasn’t even at
a crossroads and I said, ‘How convenient!’ or something.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I nodded. I did remember the man. He had taken a
seat just in front of us and, having nothing better to
do, I had observed him rather particularly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve was going on. “He had a suitcase, a black one like
this. He must have placed it in the aisle next yours and
when you got out—don’t you see—you simply picked
up his instead of yours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of all the imbecile performances!” I cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve grinned impishly. “Oh, you can laugh!” I
stormed. “But I’d like to have you tell me what I’m
going to do now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wonder what’s in it?” Eve’s curiosity, I’ve frequently
told her, will get her into trouble some day.
She had taken up the case and was shaking it gently.
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>“Not quite heavy enough for a bootlegger’s,” she
mused, “still pretty full of something.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What does it matter!” I snapped. “I’m not in the
least interested in what stringy little men are carrying
about the country. What I’m interested in is what has
become of my second best nightie and my Japanese
kimono and my toothbrush.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, well, there’s no use worrying about ’em now,”
Eve said practically. Her finger was toying with the
catch of the intruding baggage. Suddenly there
was a snap and it sprang open. The case wasn’t even
locked!</p>

<p class='c010'>I watched Eve lift the lid gingerly as if she expected
something to spring out at her. Maintaining my pose
of indifference, I did not move. But of course I could
not help seeing when the lid fell back, revealing a pile
of men’s clothing with a folded newspaper on top.
The paper fluttered to the floor as Eve poked the
clothes aside. “There might be an address,” she remarked.</p>

<p class='c010'>Underneath the clothes, we discovered a collection of
small jars and bottles. “Harry’s Hair Restorer,” Eve
read. “And what’s this—‘Harry’s Scalp Salve,’ ‘Harry’s
Magic Lotion for Baldness.’” She giggled. Then meeting
my disapproving eyes, she said: “All right, Sandy,
you’re right of course, I am a snoop. But I did
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>think we ought to look for a name or something to
go on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aren’t there any letters?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t see any.” She was putting the bottles back.
“I guess we’ll just have to take it back to the bus station
in the morning and see what they can do for us. But
don’t worry, darling, you’ll surely get your things back.
They wouldn’t do ‘Harry’ any good, you know!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But what about Aunt Cal?” I inquired anxiously.
“Shall we tell her, d’you think?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t see why not. After all, everyone makes
mistakes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ye-es,” I agreed doubtfully, “I suppose so.” I was
thinking of that speculative look in my relative’s sharp
eyes and I was quite certain that not even in the most
unguarded moment of her life would she have done
anything so stupid as to appropriate baggage which did
not belong to her.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was quite dark before we had finished discussing
what had happened and were at last ready to settle down
for the night. Eve was already in bed when I blew out
the light and went to open the window.</p>

<p class='c010'>I poked my head through the dotted Swiss curtain
into the cool sweet night. The only light spot anywhere
was the strip of sandy road beyond the fence. “Tomorrow,”
I thought, “we’ll explore that road and all
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>the others. We’ll go down to the beach and see how
cold the water is and——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What <i>are</i> you looking at?” Eve called impatiently.</p>

<p class='c010'>I turned and came toward the bed. “There’s a man
creeping along the grass on the other side of the hedge!”
I said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Creeping?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Creeping is what I said!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, dear,” Eve sighed. “I just can’t bother with any
more mysteries tonight.” She snuggled deeper into her
pillow. “Do come to bed. No doubt he’s—just—catching
fireflies—or—or—hunting bird’s nests—or something——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Her voice trailed off into nothingness. And without
another word, I climbed into bed and pulled the covers
close about me.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>When</span> I opened my eyes to a roomful of sunlight
and sea breezes, Eve was gone. My
watch had stopped. What with one thing
and another, I had forgotten to wind it. But I knew by
the look of things that the morning would never see
seven o’clock again!</p>

<p class='c010'>Stealing downstairs a quarter of an hour later, I beheld
Eve seated at the kitchen table consuming food.
No one else was in sight except a large gray cat folded
up comfortably by the stove.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is she?” I whispered, poking my head cautiously
through the doorway.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gone to market,” Eve said, resugaring her oatmeal.
“I told her you had a basketball wrist and the doctor
said you needed lots of sleep.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Eve!” I ventured toward the stove and helped
myself to oatmeal. The gray cat rose and began twining
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>himself about my feet. “I didn’t see any cat last night,”
I remarked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He comes and goes, Aunt Cal told me. I asked her,
by the way, if I might call her that and she said she
didn’t mind.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve continued to talk as I ate. “I told her about the
suitcases getting mixed,” she remarked presently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You did!” I regarded her admiringly. I had been
worrying about this ever since I woke up, wondering
how I was going to make my mistake sound plausible.
“What did she say?” I demanded anxiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve grinned. “Oh, just that she could not possibly
understand such carelessness and not knowing one’s
own baggage and so forth and so on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I nodded gloomily. I was off to a bad start with Aunt
Cal, there was no doubt of that. First this suitcase business
and then oversleeping.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She left word,” Eve continued, “that in case you
rose in time, you were to take the suitcase over to the
bus station and make inquiries of the driver when the
morning bus gets in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What time will that be?” As I spoke, I glanced at
the clock and was horrified to see that it was long past
eight.</p>

<p class='c010'>“About nine. It only makes two trips a day so we’d
better be starting soon or we’ll be late.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>Fishers Haven in the morning light was somewhat
more prosaic than in the golden glow of the evening
before. Just a straggling little village with a sprinkling
of comfortable homes and a half dozen stores or so, it
made no pretensions to the importance of a seaside
resort. But Eve did not seem to find it prosaic. She was
interested in everything from the list of sundaes in the
drug store window to the funny little cupola-like
balconies on top of some of the older houses, built so
that the wives of fishermen could look out to sea and
watch for the return of their men.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just think how thrilling when they saw a sail,” I
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But pretty tragic too if it didn’t turn out to be the
right one,” Eve returned. “And the next day maybe the
same.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We reached the bus stop ahead of time and sat down
on the wooden platform to wait. Shortly after nine, the
bus rolled in. To my relief, I saw that the driver was
the same one who had brought us over from Berkshire
Plains the afternoon before. A detached person in leggings,
he listened to my tale without emotion. “So,” he
broke into the middle of my story, “you think this guy
with spectacles took yours?”</p>

<p class='c010'>I nodded meekly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, he’ll likely turn it in at Company Headquarters
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>over in Millport. Better inquire there.” He was
turning away when Eve spoke up. “You didn’t, by any
chance,” she inquired, “happen to notice where the
spectacled gentleman got off, did you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The driver paused and looked at her. “Well, say,
now you speak of it,” he said, “I do remember. Little
chap, wasn’t he, with big specs and a straw hat? Carried
a suitcase too. I recollect now—he got off at Beecham
Corners, next stop up the line. Maybe stopped at the
Inn there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I think the best thing for us to do would be
to ride over there and inquire,” Eve said.</p>

<p class='c010'>The driver nodded and hurried away. But he was
back shortly, and five minutes later we were rolling
inland. The sandy road gave place to an uneven dirt
one and the smell of the sea to the mingled odors of
dust and gasoline, with now and then a whiff of clover
fields or flowering wayside bush. Not until we had
embarked had either of us considered how we were
to get back. I fondly hoped that, in case we had to
walk, I would not have a case full of bottles to carry
at any rate.</p>

<p class='c010'>It proved to be quite a short ride, however, and in less
than ten minutes we were climbing down at a country
crossroads. When the driver had spoken of The Inn,
my imagination had pictured a thriving hostelry—cars
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>drown up at the door under a porte cochère, tables on
a terrace, etc. It was with somewhat of a shock, therefore,
as the bus rolled away that I perceived that there was
neither a car nor a human being in sight. There were
four houses, to be sure, but the nearest of these was
boarded up and the others looked as if they might have
been permanently abandoned.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Quite a metropolis,” remarked Eve cheerfully.
“Wonder which is the Inn?”</p>

<p class='c010'>I picked up “Harry’s” luggage and trudged after her
up one of the crossroads. In the yard of one of the
houses, I perceived a woman digging dandelion greens.
The sight cheered me greatly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Over the wall, Eve inquired the way to the Inn. The
woman rose from her stooping posture and surveyed
us with some curiosity. “I ’spect you mean Trap’s place,”
she said. “It’s the big house over on the other corner. But
I wouldn’t recommend the rooms and they say the
meals——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, we weren’t thinking of stopping,” Eve assured
her hastily. “It’s just—just an errand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>From behind a damaged screen door, voices issued as
we approached the side door of “Trap’s place.” Entering,
we found ourselves in a narrow store. A woman sat
behind the counter adding a column of figures on a
brown paper bag. In the rear two men were smoking. A
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>hurried glance told me that neither resembled the
gentleman we sought.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve advanced to the counter and stated our errand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess likely it’s that Mr. Bangs you want,” the
woman said when she had finished. I was aware as she
eyed us of the same lively curiosity which had animated
the dandelion digger. “He come in last night,” she went
on. “I didn’t hear him say nothin’ ’bout no suitcase. Real
estate’s his line, he said. He was makin’ inquiries about
the old Craven House up Old Beecham way and I seen
him start off in that direction this mornin’, though it’s
the first I heard the place was for sale and what anybody’d
want an old rattletrap like that for——”</p>

<p class='c010'>This was rather of a facer; after we’d come all this
way to find our bird flown. The woman must have seen
the disappointment in our faces, for she added, “If you
walked up there right away, maybe you could catch
him. He ain’t been gone more’n half an hour.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is it—far?” I asked weakly with a hostile glance at
Mr. Bangs’ baggage on the floor at my feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not more’n ten minutes’ walk. You can leave the
case here if you want.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This seemed an inspired suggestion. And so without
further delay, we set off in the direction the woman indicated.
The road branched off the regular motor highway
and climbed casually upward, between uneven
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>stone walls and dusty foliage. “I never expected,” Eve
remarked, “to spend the first day of my vacation trailing
a barber!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mrs. Trap said he was in the real estate line.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know. But don’t forget the bottles of hair tonic.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m not likely to, if I have to lug them about the
country much more.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We walked for perhaps ten minutes without appearing
to be getting anywhere in particular. But as we
neared the brow of the hill, we spied above the trees
at a distance back from the road the gray roof of a
house. “This must be the place, don’t you think?”
Eve said. “It doesn’t look as if anybody lived
here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It certainly didn’t! The big front yard was a perfect
jungle of coarse grass and overgrown bushes and a
generally deserted and gone-to-seed air hung about the
whole place. But as we paused there a moment in the
dusty road surveying it, there drifted out to us a wave
of delicate perfume—the scent of flowering rose
bushes in the sun—which was like a gesture of welcome.</p>

<p class='c010'>Plain but substantial and built to last, as the early
settlers were wont to build them, Craven House stood
staunchly waiting for what fate held in store for it. The
blinds were closed and the weatherbeaten shingles
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>showed more than one gap where the wind and weather
had made headway.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly there came over me that curious feeling one
has at times of having been there before. “What’s the
matter,” Eve inquired. “You look as if you expected to
see a ghost or something!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, nothing,” I returned hastily. “Come on, let’s
go in. Is the gate locked?”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Eve had not stopped to discover. Already as I
spoke she was halfway over the wall. I followed her,
dropping down into a thicket on the other side that
fairly reached to my waist. I pointed silently to a dingy
sign nailed to a tree. “No Trespassing,” it said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, never mind,” said Eve lightly. “We’ve got to
find the elusive Mr. Bangs, haven’t we?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But where is he? I don’t see him anywhere about.
Maybe this isn’t the place after all,” I added, stooping
to detach a rose branch from my stocking.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s the place all right,” Eve returned. “Look, here’s
a letterbox on the gatepost!” CRAVEN, I read the
faded lettering. I wondered how many years it was
since the mail carrier had left a letter there.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Eve was now forging impatiently ahead. We
crossed the yard and made our way through a forest
of bushes around the corner of the house. In the rear,
the ground sloped gradually down to what had once
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>evidently been a quite elaborate garden. The outlines of
paths and flower beds were still discernible. And half
hidden among the bushes, I caught sight of a stone urn
and of a blackened stone figure on a pedestal. And in
the middle of it all, was the leaf-filled bowl of a fountain.
The scent of honeysuckle mingled with that of
the roses. How sweet it was, but sad too!</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly I felt Eve gripping my elbow. “There he
is!” she whispered. “Look! There on the other side of
that stone thing—creeping on the ground!” She gave
a stifled giggle. “Seems to be one of the quaint customs
of the country!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Creeping! Yes, she was right, I saw him now. A small,
intent, bent-over figure of a man, on his hands and
knees in the tall grass.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He seems very busy,” I murmured. “Perhaps we
ought not to interrupt him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nonsense, you want your suitcase, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Bangs did not see us approaching. He was, as I
have said, very much absorbed. But it was not until
we were nearly upon him that we saw that the thing
over which he was bending so intently was a tape measure.
For a full minute, I should say, we stood and
watched him. His lips were moving as if he were
making calculations.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then without warning, he jumped to his feet, dusting
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>his hands on his trousers. It was then that he saw us.</p>

<p class='c010'>Well, of course nobody likes to find that he has been
watched when he thought he was alone. Still I did
not think that this alone was enough to account for
the convulsion of anger which darkened his face. His
knobby Adam’s apple began to work up and down in
a really frightful manner, and for a moment I thought
he was going to choke.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was Eve’s velvety voice that broke the rather appalling
silence. “I’m afraid we startled you, Mr. Bangs,”
she said easily.</p>

<p class='c010'>A sort of cackling gurgle issued from the man’s
throat, which presently formed itself into words.
“Ain’t you seen the sign on the post?” he snapped,
“where’t says ‘No trespassin’’? This here’s private
property.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know,” returned Eve gently. “And we’d never
have thought of coming in if we hadn’t been looking
for you. It’s about the suitcase, you know—the one we
took by mistake.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At these words, I was relieved to see the convulsive
twitching of the man’s face subside somewhat. “So,” he
snarled, “you’re the party that run off with my baggage!
Well, what you done with it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s down at the Inn,” I answered. “It’s rather heavy
to lug around and besides I’m tired.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>“Well, I ain’t ast you to lug it, have I?” he retorted.
“’Twas your own doin’. Say, what’s your game anyway?”
he added suspiciously. “I could have you arrested,
I s’pose you know, for ’propriatin’ goods that
don’t belong to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Could you?” inquired Eve, sniffing at a white tea
rose. “But of course you wouldn’t since you’ve got it
back all safe. By the way, where is ours?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He glared at her for a moment as if he could not at
all make her out. Then with a shrug he turned away.
“It’s standin’ in the hall down to Trap’s,” he said over
his shoulder. “And the next time you go travelin’ round
the country without a nurse, I advise you to look sharp
and see whose bags ’tis you’re grabbin’.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We certainly will,” returned Eve cheerfully. “It has
taught us a lesson, I’m sure. And thank you so much,
Mr. Bangs. We’re awfully sorry to have put you to
all this inconvenience—without your hair tonic
and all!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Though the last words were uttered in a half whisper,
instantly the man’s right hand shot upward to his head.
And it was then that I noticed for the first time that the
hair that covered it was thin and graying. But his only
answer was another shrug and a grunt as he walked
away.</p>

<p class='c010'>It seemed the moment for us to depart. Looking back,
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>I saw that Mr. Bangs had again fallen on his knees in
front of the stone figure.</p>

<p class='c010'>As we turned back toward the house, I noticed that
the back door stood ajar. The real estate agent had
evidently been taking a look around before entering
into his mysterious calculations in the garden. “Let’s
take a peek inside,” I suggested. “He’ll never
see us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right,” Eve agreed. “I’ll bet there are plenty of
perfectly good family spooks living there!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ghosts,” I retorted, “are out of date.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The door led directly into a big old-fashioned kitchen.
The air smelled damp and more than a little stuffy. One
look around was enough for me. “Oh, it’s just an
ordinary old place,” I said. “Let’s not go in after all. We
must get back in time for dinner, you know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nonsense, we’ve got loads of time,” Eve said. “Come
on, I want to see what the front part is like. I adore old
houses, they’re so full of atmosphere!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nasty dank atmosphere, I call it!” I followed reluctantly
as she led the way into the hall. It was a big
wide hall, running the full length of the house, and
I could well imagine that with the doors wide open and
the sunshine and fresh air pouring in, it might have been
attractive. But it was anything but that now, and I
shivered in spite of myself as our feet echoed on the
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>bare boards. Why in the world had I ever suggested
coming in here!</p>

<p class='c010'>“This must be the parlor,” Eve was saying with her
hand on a door at the right of the hall.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, never mind if it is,” I urged. “Don’t let’s bother
now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s now or never, I suspect,” Eve returned coolly.
“What’s the matter with you, Sandy, haven’t you got
any curiosity?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t like old houses when nobody lives in ’em,”
I confessed. “They give me the creeps.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve seemed to think this funny, and the sound of her
laughter echoed back from the wide stairway. It was
uncanny—as if somebody else had laughed. And now
she was opening the door and stepping across the threshold
into the room which she had correctly guessed
was the parlor.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a wide, bare room. The windows were shuttered
and at only one place, where some of the slats
of the blind had been broken, did any light come in. This
was just enough for us to see by, though in truth there
was little to see. An old horsehair sofa and chairs, a low
carved cabinet in front of a broad fireplace, and above
the fireplace, a gilt and white mantle. The wallpaper
showing a pattern of faded rosebuds was warped
and ragged in many places.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>“I guess probably people have had lots of good times
in this room!” Eve murmured dreamily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A good place for a funeral, if you ask me!” I retorted
crossly. “Oh, do let’s get out, I don’t like the
place a bit.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, all right,” she said, turning toward the door.
“Though I should love to take a look around upstairs,”
she added with a glance toward the stairway. “I think it’s
a love——”</p>

<p class='c010'>The sentence was never finished. A sound suddenly
broke in upon the stillness. It came from the direction
of the kitchen. A sound like the closing of a door. As we
stood there in the middle of the hall, hardly realizing
what was happening, it was followed immediately by
another more ominous one—the unmistakable click
of a key as it turned in a lock.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Eve was speeding down the hall. Across the
kitchen, and pounding on the closed door. “Mr. Bangs!”
she called. “Oh, I say, wait—wait!”</p>

<p class='c010'>But there was no answer and no sound from without.
Our jailer’s retreating footsteps were already deadened
in the thick grass outside!</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>Eve</span> looked at me and I looked at Eve. “The front
windows,” I whispered. “Maybe——” I raced
back down the hall as I spoke, back to the big
front parlor. The only place from which the outside
world was visible was the broken front blind I have
mentioned. I applied my eyes to the hole. But what I
saw only made my heart sink several fathoms deeper:
it was the round-shouldered back of Mr. Bangs already
making good progress down the road. “He’s g-gone!” I
faltered, my voice ragged.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve didn’t answer for a minute. I guessed she was
getting hold of herself. “I disliked that man the moment
I set eyes on him,” she said at last.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But wh-what,” I demanded weakly, “are we going
to do?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Get out, of course. There’s always some way, a cellar
window or something.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>“But suppose there isn’t? S’pose they’re all nailed fast
like these? Suppose we have to—to spend the night
here!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve did not seem to have heard me. She was now
hurrying back down the hall to the cellar door. I listened
with my heart in my throat—if that was locked too!
Then with a scraping noise, I heard it open.</p>

<p class='c010'>I didn’t really like the idea of the cellar at all and I
liked it even less as I watched Eve’s figure disappear into
the cobwebby dimness. But I had no mind to stand waiting
alone in that awful empty house. So gathering what
shreds of courage I possessed, I plunged down after her.
It was worse even than I had imagined. The floor was
dirt under our feet and the dampness which hung about
the upstairs seemed intensified a hundredfold. I was
sure it would choke me in a minute.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Eve was pushing ahead. I could just make out
the outline of two smudgy windows above what was
probably a coal bin. But they were miles above our
heads and looked as if they had not been open for years.</p>

<p class='c010'>We made a tour of the rest of the cellar. I was clutching
Eve’s hand now, half paralyzed with fright, I might
as well admit. Once a cobweb brushed against my face
and I screamed. In a particularly dark corner where Eve
climbed onto a barrel to examine a nearby window, I
distinctly heard a rat scurry away into the shadows.
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>“Oh, do let’s go back!” I cried at last with a shudder.
“I’m positive there’s no way out down here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve was still tugging at the window. “Nailed fast,”
she announced. “This place is sure burglar proof!”</p>

<p class='c010'>All the rest of them were the same. Finally we went
back upstairs. Eve had a smudge across one cheek. At
any other time I would have laughed. “Well,” she said
quite cheerfully, “there are still the upstairs’ windows.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eve,” I said, “have you thought of this? No one
knows we’re in this house. Not even Mr. Bangs. What
I mean is that when they start looking for us, they’ll
never think of looking here!” Already I was imagining
searching parties and headlines in the newspapers.
There would be descriptions of our appearance: “Eve
Fordyce, brown eyes, short wavy hair, when last seen
was wearing a blue cotton skirt and white slipover
blouse; Sandra Hutton, green eyes, lightish hair, wearing
faded gingham dress——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mrs. Trapp or whatever her name is knows we came
up here,” Eve was saying. “And Mr. Bangs saw us outside.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You can’t depend on him for any help,” I declared
emphatically. “Oh, Eve, do you think they’ll broadcast
us among the missing persons on the radio?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course not! Oh, do cheer up, Sandy. Think what
an adventure we’ll have to tell the girls about next fall.
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>Why, it’ll go over big. Especially,” she added calmly,
“if we spend the night here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This view of the situation did not serve to cheer me
in the slightest degree. I was not concerned with the
dim and distant fall but with what was going to happen
to us right now. The thought of the night coming on,
of the darkness catching us there in that big echoing
house already sent shivers running up and down my
spine. “Oh, dear, why did we ever come in at all?” I
wailed. “It serves me right for being so snoopy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was more my fault than yours,” Eve declared consolingly.
“At least it was my fault that we stayed so
long. Now I’m going to take a look round upstairs.
Very likely they weren’t so particular about fastening
those windows.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But even if we did find one unfastened, how were
we going to get down to the ground? As I remembered
the spacious lines on which the house was built, I felt
that escape that way was hopeless from the outset. Still
there was nothing else to do so I again followed Eve,
this time up the broad curving stairway.</p>

<p class='c010'>We found ourselves in a square hall from the rear
end of which ran a narrow passage. At our right was a
large bedroom, containing a big double bed, minus
mattress or coverings. Instead of springs, there were
wooden slats. “Fancy sleeping on those!” said Eve.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>“We may come to it!” I returned miserably.</p>

<p class='c010'>The blinds were closed as they had been below, and
the two windows in the bedroom were nailed fast. The
windows in the other rooms—there were five in all—were
the same. Whoever had been assigned the task of
closing up the old Craven House had made a thorough
job of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>We returned finally to the large front room. I slumped
down on a wooden rocker by the window. My legs felt
extraordinarily weak and if I had been fasting for a
week, I could not have been hungrier. I was amazed
to see by my wrist watch that it was only a little after
two. I had thought it hours later.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve had gone back to the window. I watched her
dismally as she fussed with the fastening. “I’m going to
look for a hammer,” she announced presently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hammer?” I repeated dully as if I were unfamiliar
with the implement.</p>

<p class='c010'>She nodded. “You’ve noticed of course the difference
between these windows and the ones downstairs?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I noticed that they’re all nailed down—isn’t that
enough?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, but the ones below are nailed from the outside
but these are done from within. Consequently the
nails are all in plain sight.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mean——” I jumped up. She was right. “How
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>clever of you to notice that,” I exclaimed. “But do you
think we can ever get ’em out—they look awfully deep
in and they’re rusty besides?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m going to try anyway,” she returned. “Let’s go
downstairs and take a look for some tools.”</p>

<p class='c010'>For the first time since I had heard that back door
close, I felt a faint glimmer of hope. In a little room
off the kitchen filled with all manner of household odds
and ends, we found a tool box and in it a hammer,
brown and rusty with disuse, but still a hammer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Well, it was exactly a quarter of three when Eve set
to work on those nails. It was five minutes past before
the first one even budged. And it was nearly four before
we got the second one out. Then followed a long
struggle with the window itself. “I’ll bet those old
Cravens never did have any fresh air,” I panted. “No
wonder they’re all dead—” I was pounding the sash
with my fist in an effort to loosen it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How d’you know they’re all dead? Here, let me have
another try.” Eve pushed me aside.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last with a groan of protest, it moved—an inch,
two. I reached through and unfastened the blinds and
the sweet warm air rushed in. My, how good it smelled!</p>

<p class='c010'>The window opened onto the gently sloping tin roof
of a narrow side porch. After we had succeeded in
raising it far enough, we climbed through. It was not
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>at all clear to either of us what we were going to do
next. But anything, we felt, was better than staying
cooped up in that house any longer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Making our way cautiously to the edge of the roof,
we saw that it was, as I had anticipated, a goodish drop
to the ground. Moreover, there were no adjacent tree
branches or any of those convenient trellises that are
always so handy in the story books.</p>

<p class='c010'>We sat down with our feet braced against the gutter
to consider the situation. “Marooned on a tin roof!”
giggled Eve. The spirits of both of us had risen enormously
with our escape from the house. Some one was
bound to pass along the road sooner or later, we decided.
And though the house stood a considerable distance
back from it, still our lung power was good.</p>

<p class='c010'>The road to Old Beecham, however, was off the main
artery of travel and so far as we could see from our
perch, there was simply no sign of life anywhere. “I
can’t think,” I said, “why anyone should want to build
a house way off here, unless he was a hermit or something.
I tell you, Eve,” I added with conviction, “those
Cravens were a queer lot!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I don’t know,” Eve returned musingly. “It’s
awfully peaceful and sort of—well, self sufficient. And
I shouldn’t wonder if, when the leaves are off the trees,
you could get a glimpse of the sea off there somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>“Um—maybe.” I was wondering what Aunt Cal was
thinking by now. Any remaining shred of character
which I might have still possessed in her eyes, must
quite have vanished by this time. And if we did not get
home that night—well with a woman like Aunt Cal,
I just couldn’t imagine what would happen. It was
within the realm of possibility that she might send us
both packing after such an escapade!</p>

  <h2 id='ch05' class='c014'>V<br /> <br />John Doe, Esquire</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>The</span> minutes ticked into an hour and still no one
passed. The sun was already behind the house
and a little breeze was rustling the tall grass
and bushes below us. I shall never smell syringas again
without thinking of those hours on that tin roof. For it
was nearly two full hours before we saw anyone!</p>

<p class='c010'>Then at last we heard, not the hum of a motor for
which we had been listening, but the slow rattle of
wheels. It was a farm wagon, coming from the direction
of Old Beecham, and it was drawn by a team of
horses and driven by a boy in overalls and a blue shirt.
His head was bare and we could hear him singing
lustily to himself as he drove.</p>

<p class='c010'>At our first frantic shout, however, he turned his
head and gazed up at the house. We both stood up and
began to wave wildly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whoa-o.” We could hear the boy’s voice as he
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>brought the horses to a stop. The sound brought cheer
to our hearts. Another minute and he was vaulting over
the stone wall and coming toward us. His brown face
only a shade lighter than the shock of hair above it was
expressionless. “Anything the matter?” he drawled as
he came within earshot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, you don’t think we’re sitting on this roof for
pleasure, do you?” Eve giggled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I haven’t thought anything about it,” retorted the
boy. “But from the yell you let out just now, I judged
somebody was being murdered.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We had to make you hear,” Eve explained sweetly.
“We’ve been sitting here for two hours!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why don’t you try sitting somewhere else then if
you’re tired of it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Better view of the scenery from here,” she told him.
“By the way, you don’t happen to have a ladder in that
wagon of yours, do you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you think I am—the hook and ladder company?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I just thought I’d ask.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I felt that we weren’t getting anywhere. “Look here
Mr—er——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Doe,” the boy supplied glibly. “John Doe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve giggled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Mr. Doe,” I continued, “to put the case briefly,
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>what we want most just now is to get down from this
roof.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why don’t you go back the way you came then?”
he inquired. “You didn’t drop down from the skies, I
suppose!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s just awfully clever of you to think of that,”
Eve put in. “The only trouble with your plan is that the
doors of the house happen to be locked on the outside.
You see, the real estate agent locked us in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Real estate agent?” the boy repeated. At last there
was real astonishment in his tone. “I never heard that
this house was for sale.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never mind that now,” Eve urged impatiently.
“The point is that we’re locked in or out—whichever
way you look at it—and, to be perfectly frank with you,
there are other places where we’d rather spend the
night!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So if you could borrow a ladder from somewhere,” I
put in meekly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Or get the key from a gentleman by the name of
Bangs down at Trap’s place at the Corners,” Eve added,
“we’d be just eternally grateful.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy did not reply immediately. He seemed to be
considering the situation with an eye on the drain pipe.
“Oh, well,” he said at last with a shrug, “I suppose I’ll
have to go get a ladder.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>“The days of chivalry are past!” Eve sighed as we
watched our unwilling rescuer-to-be climb back into
his wagon, turn and drive up the road in the direction
from which he had come.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What can you expect from overalls,” I said. “Be
thankful if he remembers to come back at all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But I did him an injustice, it appeared, for less than
ten minutes later the wagon reappeared, this time loaded
with a tall ladder.</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy made no remark as he came dragging the
ladder across the yard and proceeded to prop it firmly
against the edge of the roof. “There,” he said finally
when he was satisfied that it was steady.</p>

<p class='c010'>We descended one at a time. The boy watched us
coldly. His opinion of girls who got themselves locked
in empty houses and marooned on tin roofs was apparent.
“I don’t know how we can <i>ever</i> thank you!” Eve
exclaimed as she felt that her feet were on firm earth
again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was perfectly swell of you to take all this trouble,”
I added appreciatively.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A good deed every day, that’s my motto,” drawled
the boy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just a splendid young knight errant,” I added. For
just the barest second I thought the corners of his rather
uncompromising mouth twitched. But he quickly controlled
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>them, and lifting the ladder down, began to
drag it back across the grass.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, let me help!” Eve ran after him and seized the
other end. Together they carried it as far as the wall.
“I’ll just leave it here and pick it up in the morning
when I go to work,” the boy remarked. Then with a
nod in our direction, he again vaulted over the wall.
We watched him climb into his seat and gather up the
reins. “Well, so long,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve stood beside the wagon and gazed rapturously up
at him. “Good-bye,” she said. “I suppose we shall never
see you again but I shall always treasure your memory.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You talk a lot of nonsense, don’t you?” he remarked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nonsense? Me? By the way, you aren’t going far
with that wagon, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m going home,” he stated stolidly. “And you’d
better do the same if you’ve got any.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s just the point,” Eve exclaimed brightly. “I
was wondering if by any chance—that is, we’re not
so very heavy—you see, we’re late for supper as it is.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, get in,” he said ungraciously.</p>

<p class='c010'>We needed no urging, which was fortunate. With
more speed than grace we climbed into the rear of the
wagon and in another minute were rattling down the
road toward Beecham Corners.</p>

<p class='c010'>Conversation was difficult. Only as we approached the
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>crossroads I managed to make myself heard, “Oh, my
suitcase!” I cried. “I can’t go home without my suitcase.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The horses were pulled up sharply. “What’s the
matter now?” inquired the boy.</p>

<p class='c010'>I left Eve to make explanations. I was out of the
wagon in one leap and flying up the road toward Trap’s.
I found the case in the front hall just as Mr. Bangs had
said. Nobody was about so I just took it and went out.
Panting, I returned to the wagon.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Doe’s going almost to Fishers Haven; isn’t that
luck?” Eve said as she reached down to give me a
hand. “He says we can ride as far as he goes. Or at least,”
she added, twinkling, “he didn’t say we couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was dusk when we saw the white houses of Fishers
Haven ahead of us. At a spreading farmhouse on the
outskirts, our equipage came to a stop. “This is where
I live,” the boy said.</p>

<p class='c010'>We climbed stiffly to the ground. “I suppose,” said
Eve, smiling up at the boy, “that you have no idea who
we are?”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was now our turn to be surprised. “Sure. You’re
the girls who are staying at Mrs. Poole’s.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But how in the world did you know?” she demanded.
“We only came last night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fellow who lives next door is a kind of friend of
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>mine,” he vouchsafed shortly. “Tells me all his
troubles.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But,” giggled Eve, “we’re not one of his troubles,
are we? At least not yet!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy made no reply to this but gathered up his
reins preparatory to turning into the drive.</p>

<p class='c010'>I remembered suddenly the dark figure I had seen
creeping along the hedge last night. “What kind of
troubles has your friend?” I called hastily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, cat troubles mostly.” The words drifted back
as the wagon rattled away.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did he say ‘cat’?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sounded like it,” said Eve.</p>

  <h2 id='ch06' class='c014'>VI<br /> <br />A Piece of Paper</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>Aunt Cal</span> listened to our story without interruption
at supper that night. Only at my first mention
of the old Craven House, I fancied I saw
an odd expression flit across her face. But her only comment,
when we had finished, was the dry remark that
the next time we felt moved to go poking about empty
houses, we’d better make sure that the key was on the
inside.</p>

<p class='c010'>Following Eve upstairs that night, I found her standing
in the middle of the room, scowling over a scrap of
paper. “Is this anything of yours, Sandy?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>I peered at it over her shoulder. It was a soiled and
dog-eared piece of notepaper which had been folded
twice. Scrawled across the middle, I read: “Circe south
13-6, 90 degrees W. 7 dig here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I never saw it before. Where did you find it, Eve?”
I said, looking at it curiously.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>“Saw it lurking under the bed as I came into the
room,” she explained. “It doesn’t seem like Aunt Cal
to leave pieces of old letters about.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you think it is?” I asked, still staring at the
strange inscription. “A ship’s log maybe? Circe sounds
like the name of a ship.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps. But ‘dig here’—what about that? That’s
not exactly nautical, is it?” Eve returned musingly.
Suddenly she lifted the paper to her face and sniffed at
it. “Harry’s Hair Restorer!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What!” I sniffed too. She was right. The scent of
Mr. Bangs’ lotions when we had opened his suitcase
had permeated everything. It was unmistakable. “Then—then,”
I stammered, “this letter, or whatever it is,
must be his. Must have fallen out when we opened the
suitcase!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Looks like it. And the wind probably blew it under
the bed when you opened the window. That’s why we
didn’t notice it before.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder if it’s anything important,” I mused.
“What do you make of it, Eve?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve sat on the sea chest, her eyes round and big.
“Sandy,” she said slowly, “if I read it in a story book,
I would think of just one thing!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mean—treasure?” I asked in a half whisper.</p>

<p class='c010'>She nodded. “But of course in real life,” she went on
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>hurriedly, “well, you know yourself, Sandy, real life
is different, however much you try to make yourself
believe otherwise.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” I admitted, “I know it is. But—look here!” I
shot bolt upright on the bed with the suddenness of the
thought that had come to me. “What do you suppose
that man was doing in that garden today?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why,” said Eve, “he was measuring, surveying or
something, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Surveyors don’t crawl on their knees,” I said. “And
besides, he hadn’t any instruments, only a tape measure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve looked at me solemnly. “What are you driving
at?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, this paper is his, isn’t it? And it’s got measurements
on it. And he was measuring. It sounds crazy,
of course, still——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But he didn’t have the paper; it was here under
the bed!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I know. But he might have had it in his head,
mightn’t he—the numbers, I mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t mean you actually think, Sandy, that that
man was looking for buried treasure?” Eve’s voice
had fallen to a whisper, too, now.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know what to think,” I returned.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He certainly was annoyed when he saw us watching
him!” Eve said thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>“Annoyed is putting it mildly,” I said. “I thought
he was going to strangle!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve nodded. “Do you know,” she said, “I felt there
was something very odd about him from the first.
Take his hair, for one thing——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Somebody has taken it, or most of it!” I giggled.
“He certainly isn’t much of an advertisement for his
old lotions!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not today. But he was yesterday when we saw him
on the bus, don’t you remember?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, that’s so! I do remember he had thick brown
hair that stuck out all around under his hat. I noticed
it particularly, it didn’t seem to go with his face somehow.
You don’t think it could have been——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A wig, of course!” Eve cried. “That settles it! That
man is up to some funny business, you can depend
upon it. Of course he wasn’t expecting to see anybody
out there in the garden today. I dare say he’d found
the wig hot and had taken it off and laid it in the grass
or hung it on a branch or something!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Still, whatever he’s up to,” I said thoughtfully, “I
suppose we’ll have to return his property to him. We
can mail it to him in care of Trap’s Inn, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right. You’ll find an envelope in that top drawer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When I turned with the envelope, Eve was jotting
down something in her diary. “No harm keeping a
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>copy of those figures,” she remarked. “Just as a matter
of curiosity, you know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We mailed the letter to Mr. Bangs next morning.
We hoped that we would receive some acknowledgment
of its receipt, something which might shed some
further light on the mystery. But the days went by and
nothing came.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of course, a man who wears a wig may or may not
be a villain. As Eve pointed out, he may have worn it
for professional purposes solely. If he was a vendor of
hair lotions, then the wig was a kind of advertisement.
But even so, I argued, it was deceitful and misleading
and I felt that our first impression of the man was
abundantly justified.</p>

<p class='c010'>We spoke frequently of making another trip to the
old house to try to find out for ourselves what he was
up to. But fear of incurring Aunt Cal’s disapproval
held us back. It would be extremely difficult to explain
to my severe-minded relative what had taken us there.
To discuss anything so fantastic as buried treasure with
Aunt Cal seemed out of the question.</p>

<p class='c010'>Meanwhile our life at Fishers Haven flowed along
serenely. We found that Aunt Cal was not hard to get
along with, once you adapted yourself to her ways. She
had lived so long alone that she couldn’t help being
rather set in her habits, Eve said. Indeed it was due
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>mostly to Eve’s tact and diplomacy that things went so
smoothly. Eve had had some experience in visiting relatives
and, though she admitted that none of them was
in the least like my aunt, still, as she said, when you go
to stay in somebody else’s house, you just have to make
up your mind to doing things differently than when you
are in your own home.</p>

<p class='c010'>We began to feel quite at home too in the village,
at the stores where Aunt Cal “traded” and at the post
office where we went for the mail each morning and
at any other odd moment when time hung too heavily
on our hands. We explored the shore for miles and,
covering our bathing suits modestly with coats in deference
to Aunt Cal’s proprieties, walked to the beach for
a swim nearly every day.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was one afternoon when we returned rather late
from one of these expeditions that we found the kitchen
door locked. The key was under the mat where Aunt
Cal—with what Eve called a painful lack of imagination—always
placed it if she went out while we were
away. We let ourselves in and found a note on the
kitchen table addressed to me.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have gone to Old Beecham to see a sick friend
who has just sent for me. Rose Blossom is driving
me out. May have to spend the night. If I am not
back by nine, put Adam in the kitchen, lock up
and go to bed.</p>

<div class='c012'>Hastily, &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div class='c012'>Aunt Cal.”</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>“Hurrah!” I cried, seizing the startled Adam from
his cushion and beginning to waltz with him about the
kitchen.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t,” remarked Eve, “seem so awfully depressed
at the news of Aunt Cal’s suffering friend!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wasn’t thinking of her at all,” I confessed. “I was
wondering if we couldn’t make a Welsh rarebit for
supper. I’m fed up with beans and fried potatoes.” For
some reason Aunt Cal’s note had filled me with a
strange exhilaration. The thought of being on our own,
if only for a few hours, was exciting. “Why, we won’t
even have to wash the dishes if we don’t want to! And
we can sit up as late as we please.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The odor of toasting cheese is delectable at all times.
Never have I known it so delicious as it was that night.
Adam, too, seemed to find the atmosphere of the kitchen
particularly attractive for, even after he had finished
his supper of fried fish, he lingered, purring and twining
himself about my feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He wants some of the rarebit, I guess,” Eve said,
dropping a morsel onto his plate.</p>

<p class='c010'>Somewhat to my disappointment, Eve elected to
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>wash the dishes as usual. “Better cover up all guilty
tracks,” she laughed.</p>

<p class='c010'>But we soon had them out of the way and after everything
was in order again, we went out into the soft,
sweet smelling dusk, the cat at our heels. There is a
little bench under the locust tree where we had formed
the habit of sitting in the evening and watching Adam
at his capers. For, while in the daytime, he is staid and
dignified in the extreme, in the evening he loosens up
considerably and, given a toad or a grasshopper, will
cavort with mild abandon up and down the garden
path and beds. But we were always cautioned by Aunt
Cal to keep our eyes on him and be sure that he did
not stray beyond the hedge into her neighbor’s domain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tonight the rarebit or something seemed to have
made him unusually lively. He darted about quite
wildly and even in one moment of abandon so far forgot
his years as to chase his tail. “It’s because Aunt Cal’s
away,” I said. “I know just how he feels.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve was lying on her back, trying to find Jupiter. “I
wish we could think of something exciting to do,” I
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You might try chasing your tail,” she murmured.
“I think stars are exciting.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course, if you start thinking about them,” I
agreed. “Still, you can look at them most any time.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>“You hardly ever see so many as there are tonight.
See, there’s the Little Dipper!”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was while I was trying to see the Little Dipper that
Adam saw his chance. I think very likely the sly thing
had been waiting for just that moment when both our
heads should be lifted to the sky.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where’s Adam?” Eve asked presently, coming back
to earth.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He was here just a moment ago.” I got up. “Adam,
Adam!” I called.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then suddenly, almost like an echo—but not quite—from
the other side of the hedge I heard a voice.
“Caliph, Caliph!” it said.</p>

<p class='c010'>I stopped short. In the darkness of the adjoining yard,
I saw the figure of Aunt Cal’s neighbor, a short plump
gentleman of seafaring aspect who went in the village
by the title of Captain Trout but whom Aunt Cal herself
referred to with some asperity as “that man next
door.” “Caliph, Caliph!” he called again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t know he had a cat,” whispered Eve at my
side. Then just in front of us we saw Adam scurrying
toward the hedge. In a second he was through it and
bounding across the yard toward the summoning voice.
“He thinks he’s calling him,” I said. “I guess I’d better
go after him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I negotiated the hedge with only a scratch or two on
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>my legs and flew after the runaway. “Adam,” I called.
“Come back here, you bad cat!”</p>

<p class='c010'>But even as I spoke the words, I saw the round figure
beyond me stoop and gather the cat in his arms.
“Caliph, you rascal,” he scolded, “where have you been
keeping yourself?” He did not appear to see Eve or
me at all but just went on stroking and scolding the
cat by turns.</p>

<p class='c010'>Finally Eve cleared her throat. “I think,” she said
politely, “you’ve got the wrong cat, haven’t you? That’s
our Adam, you know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At the words, the man’s head jerked up. “What,” he
snapped, “are you talking about?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“About Adam, our cat,” said Eve coolly. “It’s long
past his bedtime.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was quite a pause after this during which the
Captain went on stroking the cat. “You see,” I put in
at last out of sheer embarrassment, “he had Welsh rarebit
for supper and it sort of went to his head——”</p>

<p class='c010'>But I never finished the sentence. With a sudden
soldierly swing, the figure in front of us turned round
and, still bearing the cat in his arms, marched toward
the back door of his house.</p>

  <span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>
  <h2 id='ch07' class='c014'>VII<br /> <br />Caliph</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>Too</span> surprised to move, we stood and watched
him. Then I caught Eve by the hand. “Why,
we can’t let him carry off Adam like that!” I
cried. “What will Aunt Cal say? Why, it’s highway
robbery—stealing our cat before our eyes!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think he’ll invite us in,” Eve observed with
something suspiciously like a giggle. “Seems sort of a
crusty old bird.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But we can’t stand here and do nothing!” I was
starting forward when I saw that the back door of the
house had opened from within. For a moment another
figure stood there, etched against the light. Then the
Captain entered and the door closed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well,” I cried, “I’m not going to stand for that!
Eve, maybe—maybe they’re vivisectionists or something—going
to cut his poor little insides out!”</p>

<p class='c010'>At this gruesome suggestion, however, Eve only
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>laughed again. “How you do let your imagination run
on, Sandy!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just the same, are you going to let that man steal
my aunt’s cat?” I demanded. “You know what ‘store
she sets by Adam.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I’m thinking,” said Eve. “I think perhaps
there’s some misunderstanding.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Misunderstanding!” I scoffed. “I tell you that man’s
nothing but a common thief. Probably knows Aunt Cal’s
away and thinks he can get away with it. But I guess
he’ll find he’s mistaken!” With that I advanced boldly
toward the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a light in the kitchen window and I could
hear movements inside as I crossed the little porch and
knocked loudly on the door. Eve was in the shadow
just behind. After a minute the door opened and the
figure I had seen there before stood in the light of an
oil lamp which was burning in a wall bracket behind
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you want?” It was not a gruff voice like
Captain Trout’s, but clear and a little chilly. Moreover
there was something distinctly familiar about it. But I
did not stop to place it. Instead, I stepped boldly across
the threshold and faced the owner squarely. He turned
and the light fell on his face. It was John Doe.</p>

<p class='c010'>But I did not let my momentary astonishment distract
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>me from my purpose. “We’ve come for our cat,”
I stated.</p>

<p class='c010'>Looking beyond the boy, I saw the Captain in the act
of pouring out a saucer of milk. “He’s had his supper,”
I said. “And besides he likes his milk warmed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess I know what he likes,” snapped the Captain,
setting the saucer of milk down on the floor beside
the stove.</p>

<p class='c010'>I took an indignant step forward. But Eve’s restraining
hand was on my arm. “Wait a minute, Sandy,”
she urged. “If Captain Trout wants to give Adam a little
refreshment, surely there’s no harm in that. I’m going
outside to have a little chat with Mr. Doe. You’d better
come along.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I hesitated, looking from the ruddy face of the Captain,
bent solicitously over the cat, to the impassive one
of John Doe where he stood like a sentinel guarding
the door. Suddenly the whole situation became funny.
“Eve,” I said, “doesn’t he remind you of Horatius at
the Bridge or something!”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Eve was saying something to him in a low appealing
voice and the next moment, somewhat to my surprise,
we were all three standing together on the little
back porch with the door closed behind us. “Now,”
said Eve, “please, Mr. Doe, do tell us what all this cat
business is about?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>“Oh, don’t call me that,” said the boy impatiently.
“You know it isn’t my name.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Naturally,” returned Eve, “but since it’s the name
you gave us——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I was just kidding. My name’s Michael Gilpatrick.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What an awfully nice name,” Eve smiled. She seated
herself on one of the built-in benches at the end of the
porch. “Now,” she said, “we can talk. Tell us about the
cat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael Gilpatrick leaned against the post. “Well,”
he said, “I suppose I might as well. But I don’t want
you to think I’m taking sides in the matter. Of course
I’m a friend of the Captain, still I can see that there’s
something to be said on both sides.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Okay,” said Eve. “Having stated your position,
please proceed. You must remember that we’re all in
the dark. We never had the slightest inkling that there
was any mystery surrounding Adam until tonight. Of
course we knew that Aunt Cal and the Captain weren’t
exactly on cordial terms.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And that the Captain had a habit of creeping along
hedges after dark,” I put in.</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael’s straight mouth twitched a little, but he
quickly regained his solemnity. “Well,” he began, “it’s
quite a long story. Goes back to the winter before last.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>“Adam must have been something of a kitten then,”
Eve suggested.</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael nodded. “It was about Christmas time, I
think, that Captain Trout bought this little house and
settled down here with his invalid wife.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, I didn’t know——” I began, but Eve
whispered, “Hush!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They got this kitten—a kitten, that is,” he went on.
“It came to them on Christmas Day and Mrs. Trout
made a big fuss over it. They called it Caliph.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What a flight of fancy!” I murmured.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s what they named it,” said Michael stolidly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, go on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Some time in February, one cold night when the
thermometer was below zero, the cat disappeared.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You didn’t tell us this was a sob story,” I put in, feeling
for my handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hush, Sandy,” said Eve. “How did he happen to
disappear?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know—he just vanished, the way cats do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Night life and all that?” I queried.</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy ignored my frivolity. “The next day Mrs.
Trout was ill and the Captain was so occupied with
nursing her that he didn’t think very much about the
cat’s absence. But later, when he began to look about and
make inquiries, he couldn’t find any trace of him.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>“And so a year went by,” I prompted, “and still no
trace of the missing che-ild!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, it wasn’t quite a year. It was the next fall,
October, I believe. Mrs. Trout had died that summer
and the Captain was living here alone. One day he saw
Caliph across the hedge. He was following your aunt,
Mrs. Poole, about the garden.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How,” I demanded, “did he know it was Caliph?
A cat grows a lot in—let me see—eight months, wasn’t
it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He thought it was Caliph,” continued Michael, “and
he went over and told Mrs. Poole so. But she said it was
her cat Adam. She said she’d found him starving on
the street the week before and had brought him home.
Then Captain Trout explained about his cat, Caliph,
running away last February and all. But it was no use.
Mrs. Poole remained—er—unconvinced.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Naturally,” I exclaimed. “Why, the world’s practically
full of Maltese cats and to tell one from another
after it’s had eight months to grow in—why, I don’t
blame Aunt Cal in the least.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael regarded me gravely. “Well,” he said, “I’m
just giving you the facts as I learned them. Of course,
the whole thing is rather silly,” he added, “but you see
the Captain was attached to Caliph on account of his
wife and all, and should know his own cat.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>“Of course,” said Eve. “He didn’t have seven toes or
anything like that?” she suggested hopefully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not that I know of.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But look here!” I fairly bounced off my seat with
the force of the idea that had come to me. “Why don’t
they simply put it to the test. Get together, I mean, and
each call the cat in turn. If he answers to Adam—why,
then he’s ours, I mean Aunt Cal’s. But if he comes to
Captain Trout——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael shook his head. “No good,” he said. “As a
matter of fact, the cat answers to any old name you
happen to call him!”</p>

  <h2 id='ch08' class='c014'>VIII<br /> <br />A Scalp Lock</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>I confess</span> I felt a little flat when Michael Gilpatrick
said that. I had been so sure for the moment that
I had hit on a brilliant solution of the problem
that now I was inclined to wash my hands of so stupid
a cat once and for all. But I remembered that Aunt Cal
had particularly entrusted him to our care. “What,”
I asked, “are we going to say to my aunt when she
comes home and finds no Adam? She’s just as much attached
to him as Captain Trout is to—to Caliph. Why,
she might come back any minute now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As I spoke, I glanced over toward the house where
it stood dark and silent beyond the hedge. Suddenly I
saw something that made me jump up and grab Eve’s
arm. “Why,” I cried, “I do believe she’s back already!
Look! There’s a light upstairs in that window at the
end!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What!” Eve and Michael were at my side. For a
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>minute, as we all stood there, everything was in darkness.
Then there came again the faint flicker of light
that I had seen at the upper window. “Looks like a
flashlight,” said Michael. “Or maybe a candle.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But why should Aunt Cal be going around the house
with a candle? There are plenty of lamps and they’re
always filled.”</p>

<p class='c010'>No one answered. The light was moving from window
to window now. “Sandy,” said Eve, faintly, “I
don’t believe it’s Aunt Cal at all!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It looks to me,” remarked Michael, “as if there was
somebody in the house that didn’t want to be seen.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mean a burglar?” I cried. “Oh, Eve, we left
the back door wide open. And there’s the silver in the
dining room chest——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Guess I’d better have a look,” remarked Michael
abruptly, starting down the steps.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, do you think you’d better?” asked Eve anxiously.
“S’pose he has a gun or something!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael did not say “Pooh!” but the set of his
shoulders suggested the word as he strode toward the
hedge. He cleared it with one leap and disappeared
from sight in the direction of Aunt Cal’s back door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come on,” I said, trying to sound cool and collected.
“I’m not afraid!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course not,” agreed Eve, giving me her hand.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>We reached the path where we had been sitting just
a few moments before. The mysterious light had disappeared,
there was no sound anywhere.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cautiously we advanced. “There’s a lamp on the
shelf just inside the kitchen door,” I stated half-heartedly.
“And the matches are just beside it. It would
only take a minute to light it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve did not answer. Suddenly she stopped and I felt
her hand tighten in mine. “Listen! What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>From somewhere inside the house a vague clatter
reached us—a shuffling noise—the thud of something
falling. Then, quite close at hand, came the scud and
scurry of running feet! Immediately after we heard the
beat of quick panting breaths and two flying figures
hurtled past us into the night!</p>

<p class='c010'>With one accord, we turned and followed them. But
they had vanished into the blackness of the lower
garden almost before we knew it. Back of the garden
is a steep bank, ending in a muddy ditch. If they’d gone
down that, it looked like a pretty sure spill for both
of them. The thought sent us hurrying on. We reached
the stone wall which forms the lower border of Aunt
Cal’s property. Eve shouted frantically into the darkness,
“Michael, where are you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no answer. I climbed gingerly onto the
wall. I thought of the muddy ditch at the bottom of
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>the bank and I had a vision of Michael lying there
wounded and bleeding. “Michael,” I called, “are you
down there?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then to our infinite relief, a faint voice answered,
“Coming!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Presently we heard him thrashing his way upward.
Finally he stumbled out from the bushes below where
we stood. Even in the darkness, we could see that his
clothes were a wreck. And there was a dark patch on
his forehead—though this subsequently turned out to
be mud. “Oh, you’re hurt!” Eve cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, not fatally!” he panted as he reached the wall
and sank down upon it. “But the rascal got away,
worse luck! If I hadn’t caught my foot in a branch down
there, I’d have had him. As it is, all I got is this!” He
held up a fuzzy-looking object.</p>

<p class='c010'>We peered at it. “What in the world——?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Big Injun scalp lock!” chuckled Michael.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve put out her hand and touched it gingerly. “You
mean—he wore a wig!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Looks like it. I grabbed at his hair just as I fell.
When it came off in my hand, I thought I must be
seeing things!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Abruptly Eve leaned over and sniffed at the wig.
“Harry’s Hair Restorer!” she announced.</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael looked at her in amazement. “Mean to say
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>you know the gentleman? Perhaps he wasn’t a burglar
after all?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If he wasn’t,” answered Eve slowly, “then I don’t
know what he was doing in our house! Unless—unless
he came after the letter!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But we sent it back to him,” I cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know, but maybe he didn’t get it. Maybe he didn’t
go back to Trap’s—don’t you see? But he wanted the
letter and when he didn’t find it in his suitcase, he—he
came after it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael got up from the wall. “Well, I guess I’ll be
getting on,” he said stiffly. “Of course, if I’d known
you were acquainted with the fellow——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But we’re not—not really. Oh, wait a minute,
please!” Eve put out her hand to hold him back. “If
you’ll just give us a chance we’ll tell you all about it.
In fact, I think it’s time we told somebody.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Back at the house after we had helped Michael remove
some of the mud from his person, we told him
the story; first of Mr. Bangs’ activities in the garden
of Craven House and then of the piece of paper with
the odd inscription, which we had found.</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael listened without comment. But when we
had finished he said, “I felt there was something suspicious
about that real estate agent when you first mentioned
him. I happen to know that Craven House isn’t
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>for sale and isn’t likely to be and I couldn’t imagine why
anyone should be up there measuring the ground. And
now this wig and this letter business makes it look
queerer than ever.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What d’you think it’s all about anyway?” Eve asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael shook his head thoughtfully. “It looks as if
he was after something. Something that’s hidden—or
he thinks is hidden at Craven House. I wonder——”
He paused and gazed meditatively into space. “Suppose
we take a look around here,” he suggested at last, “to
see if there’s anything missing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s so,” I said, “I hadn’t thought of that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve took up the lamp and together we made a tour
of the house. Upstairs we found that every dresser
drawer had been rummaged and, in many cases, the
contents scattered on the floor. Eve’s empty traveling
bag and my suitcase were lying open in our room. But
aside from this and the chairs he had overturned in
his flight through the lower part of the house, the intruder
seemed to have done no damage. And so far as
we could discover, nothing was missing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Back in the kitchen, we returned to the discussion of
what was to be done. Michael, now that we had furnished
a mystery for him to solve, had entirely dropped
his standoffish attitude. He agreed with us that the only
way to find out what the mysterious Mr. Bangs was
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>after was to keep our own counsel for the present.
Michael was anxious to take a look at the exact spot
where we had found him at work in the garden, and
we finally arranged to meet him there the next day
after his work at the farm was over and to bring with
us a copy of the letter.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not until after Michael had gone and Eve
and I had restored everything to its accustomed order
that I remembered Adam. But the house beyond the
hedge was dark; Captain Trout had evidently retired.
The cat problem, we decided, would just have to wait.</p>

  <h2 id='ch09' class='c014'>IX<br /> <br />Daisy June and the Blue Emerald</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>I was</span> awakened early next morning by the clatter
of a heavy wagon on the road in front of the house.
Stealing to the window in order not to awaken Eve,
I was just in time to catch sight of a familiar, blue-shirted
figure in the driver’s seat. Michael! What was
he doing in this part of town so early in the morning?</p>

<p class='c010'>When I went downstairs I found the explanation.
Eve was still asleep and, pleased to have got the start
of her for once, I resolved to have breakfast on the table
by the time she came down. I unlocked the kitchen door
and went out to bring in the milk which is left in a
pail every morning. Beside the pail I found a paste-board
box. As I stooped to pick it up I saw there were
holes pierced in the top. And when I lifted it—it
mewed!</p>

<p class='c010'>A cat! I pulled off the lid. No, a kitten—a plump gray
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>one with china-blue eyes and a white spot in its forehead.
The mew changed to a noisy purr as I lifted it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What are you doing?” Eve, looking very nice in a
fresh blue linen dress, was standing in the doorway. In
my absorption I had forgotten all about breakfast. Then
Eve saw the kitten. “Oh, the darling! Where did you
find it, Sandy?”</p>

<p class='c010'>I pointed to the box and told her about Michael. “I
suppose the idea is,” I said, “that one cat is as good as
another. But I doubt very much if Aunt Cal will even
give it house room!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, it was nice of him to think of it anyway!”
Eve returned, cuddling the kitten. “I wonder if it’s
hungry?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Cal returned at ten o’clock. Eve was just taking
a loaf of gingerbread from the oven when I heard
the car. Miss Rose Blossom was at the wheel, there was
no mistaking her broad figure. She was beaming at
Aunt Cal as she handed down her bag.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She’s coming!” I whispered, tiptoeing back into the
kitchen. “What shall we do with Daisy June?” I glanced
a little wildly toward Adam’s cushion by the stove where
the kitten slept.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before Eve could even answer, a firm step sounded
outside. Aunt Cal stood in the doorway. “Well,” she
inquired, “how have you been getting on?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>I stood in front of the stove. “Splendid——” I began
and then, fearing I sounded too enthusiastic, I changed
hastily to “All right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How is your friend?” Eve asked, inserting a knife
around the gingerbread.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A little better. Her sister came over from Millport
this morning, so I felt that I could leave. Mercy, child,
I didn’t know you could bake!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, of course, it isn’t as good as yours,” Eve began
modestly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Cal picked up her bag and started for the stairs.
It was this moment that Daisy June took to wake from
her nap. With a sinking heart, I felt her between my
ankles. Aunt Cal stopped dead in the middle of the
room. “Where,” she inquired in a very stuffy voice, “did
that come from? And where is Adam?”</p>

<p class='c010'>I swallowed. “Adam’s visiting—visiting Captain
Trout,” I said.</p>

<p class='c010'>My relative’s face became stonier than before. “Take
that cat out of the house!” she ordered.</p>

<p class='c010'>I took a deep breath and counted ten. Then picking
up Daisy June, I retreated to the side yard. Eve joined
me there presently, carrying the box of carpet rags we
were sewing for Aunt Cal. “Eve,” I asked solemnly,
“what is to become of her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know,” she said. “But I can’t believe that
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>anything so adorable wasn’t brought into the world for
a purpose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We didn’t get much sewing done that morning for
practically every time we picked up a strip of cloth Daisy
June was dangling on the end of it and as fast as Eve
wound the balls, the kitten unwound them. When we
went in for dinner, we left her sleeping peacefully in
the box. She at any rate had no misgivings about the
future.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I see somebody has been trampling the petunia bed,”
remarked Aunt Cal, dishing out lamb stew and dumplings.
“But I suppose it’s no more than is to be expected
when one leaves things to take care of themselves!”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was Eve who persuaded my aunt to go upstairs
after dinner for a rest. “After being up all night,” she
urged, “it’s the only sensible thing to do.” And though
Aunt Cal declared stoutly that she did not hold with
naps in the daytime, she finally yielded.</p>

<p class='c010'>After we had finished the dishes Eve carried out a
saucer of milk for Daisy June. To our dismay the kitten
was gone. There was her bed of carpet rags, still matted
where her soft form had lain, but no sign of its late
occupant. We searched every corner of the yard, calling
softly so that Aunt Cal would not hear. But neither the
yard nor garden yielded any trace of her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Could she have got through the hedge, I wondered?
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>I went to look. And there she was, big as life, sauntering
up the path toward the Captain’s back door. I
beckoned to Eve. “Look,” I whispered, “for all the
world as if she was about to drop in on a friend for tea
or something!”</p>

<p class='c010'>I was about to pop through the hedge after her when
the back door of the house opened and the owner himself
emerged. He was jauntily dressed in immaculate
white trousers and a nautical blue jacket. I wondered
how he managed, living alone as he did, always to look
so spick and span. He was descending the steps when
he met the kitten. “Bless my boots!” The words floated
across the quiet air. “Now where in blazes did you
come from?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Daisy June’s answer was to leap up the intervening
step and begin her accustomed twining movement about
the Captain’s ankle. I hurried forward. “Oh, I’m so
sorry,” I began, “we do have such trouble with our cats!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Daisy June continued to twine like a boa constrictor.
The Captain retreated and abruptly sat down in the big
rocker which occupied the center of the porch. Without
hesitation the kitten jumped into his lap. I thought for
a second that he was going to push her down, but instead
he asked abruptly, “How’s your aunt this morning?
Much upset, was she?”</p>

<p class='c010'>I collected my thoughts. “Oh, you mean about
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>Adam,” I was beginning, when Eve came up behind
me. “Aunt Cal wouldn’t allow herself to be upset by so
little a thing as that,” she said with one of her dazzling
smiles. “She’s much too—a—strong-minded.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Captain appeared as surprised as I was to hear
this. “Well, well, well,” he said, “I want to know!”
Mechanically, it seemed, his hand went out to stroke
the kitten’s back and, thus encouraged, she reached up
one fat paw for the large gold chain that spanned his
waistcoat. “Hi, there, look at that now! Caliph allus
used to go after that chain when he was a kitten. Well,”
he added, “I’m glad to hear your aunt wasn’t upset.
Old Judd Craven allus did say she was the only sensible
one in the family!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Judd Craven?” I repeated. “Who was he?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What? What’s that? Mean to say you ain’t never
heard of Cap’n Judd? Why, he was related to you in a
sort of way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Related to me? But how? Do you mean that he was
related to Aunt Cal?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mercy me, yes. He was her uncle. Cal’s mother was
Susan Craven. Cap’n Judd used to set great store by Cal
when she was a young one, used to bring her things
every time he come back from a voyage.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve dropped down on the step. “Do tell us about
Captain Judd,” she begged. “You see, we were up at
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>the place they call Craven House the other day, so
we’re interested. Did he build it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Captain shook his head. “No, it was an old
house—dates back to the early settlers. Cap’n Judd
bought it and made it over. It was one of the show
places of the countryside in his day. He fixed it up for
his wife, Emily, who wanted to live inland out of sight
of the sea. Emily hated the sea. Besides that, Judd had
a kind of notion he wanted to go in for farming. It
was the dream of his life to found a landed estate like
the ones he’d seen in England—handed down from
father to son like. But—well, it didn’t work out. Carter
didn’t take to farming; he was a restless chap, wanted
to see the world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Carter was his son?” I prompted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aye, Carter was his only child.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It sounds quite like a story out of a book,” Eve
commented.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Captain chuckled. “Yeah, it would make good
reading, I calculate, if all the facts of Judd’s career was
set down. A lively old bird he was, full of funny ideas,
allus getting himself talked about. Not in a bad way,
you understand, just odd—doing things different from
the run of folks.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Was it he who set up those statues and vases and
things in the garden?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>“Aye, that was one of the things. Those statues made
a great stir. Folks round here had never heard tell of
statues in a garden. They used to drive from all around
just to see ’em.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But where in the world did he get them?” asked
Eve. “They look awfully old.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Uh-huh, they was meant to. Judd said he got ’em
from a Greek temple, but I guess more likely he picked
them up in a second-hand shop in Athens. Judd allus
was one for a joke. There was one he called Mercury
and one Diana.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Diana—Mercury,” Eve repeated thoughtfully.
“There wasn’t—wasn’t one called Circe, was there?”</p>

<p class='c010'>I held my breath. The Captain began to fill his pipe.
“Circe? Well now, there might have been at that; I
can’t rightly tell all the names he gave ’em.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me,” Eve demanded, leaning forward with sudden
eagerness, “did Captain Craven leave any—any
money—or valuables or anything?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Captain Trout shook his head. “I guess Carter got
most of the money before the old man died. Judd used
to say in his later days that all he had in the world
was the place. That and the blue emerald,” he added,
with a chuckle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The blue emerald?” I cried. “But how could an
emerald be blue? I thought they were green.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>“That’s what I never could figger out myself,” the
Captain answered. “I never saw it myself. Some said
it was give him by a Rajah in India ’count of some service
he done him. But the Cap’n allus was pretty mysterious
about it—liked to keep folks guessing. Me, I didn’t
take much stock in that Rajah chap. But most folks used
to eat up the whole story.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did anyone ever see the emerald?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never heard as they did. But then I was away for
years. After the Cap’n retired and built his house, I
didn’t see him very often. But every now and then when
I’d come home, I’d hear talk about the blue emerald and
every time it was wo’th a little more. It sure had the
villagers mesmerized.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And Captain Judd’s son?” I asked hesitantly. “What
became of him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Captain puffed on his pipe and absently put down
his hand to stroke the kitten’s back. “Carter disappeared
about a year after his father’s death,” he said. “I ain’t
heard tell of him since.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He didn’t,” inquired Eve, “take the blue emerald
with him, did he?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Some said so,” Captain Trout answered. “But I
reckon no one rightly knows. But the house—that
rightly belongs to your aunt, I was told.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To Aunt Cal!” I cried in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>“Aye. Judd promised her she should have it. But the
will, they say, was never found. Some say Carter didn’t
want it should be, that he was jealous of Cal for bein’
in the old man’s good graces. But that’s just gossip, I
reckon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think Captain Judd must have been a very interesting
person,” declared Eve. “I wish I’d known
him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aye, he was a fine chap. Great loss to the community,
his death was.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you very much for telling us about him,”
I said. I felt that we ought to go back before Aunt Cal
came downstairs. I got up, looking doubtfully at the
sleeping kitten. It seemed a pity to disturb her.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Captain appeared to read my thoughts. “Better
let her sleep,” he said. “You can stop by for her later—if
you want.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As he uttered these words, I was conscious that another
figure had joined our group. Adam had come out
of the open kitchen door. He stood for a moment surveying
us, advanced to the Captain, sniffed gingerly
at the object in his lap; then, without a word—as it
were—turned and walked down the steps.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Caliph,” called the Captain, “where you going?”
But only a wave of the tail answered him.</p>

<p class='c010'>When we got back to our house, a half emptied saucer
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>of fish was on the back porch and Caliph, alias Adam,
was asleep on his cushion by the stove.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I feel,” I giggled, “a little dizzy with all this cat
business!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To say nothing,” added Eve, “of blue emeralds!”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>Michael</span> was waiting for us at The Corners
at five that afternoon. He had left the horses
tied there in order not to attract attention
to our visit to Craven House. “Haven’t seen anything
more of Bangs, have you?” was his first question.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve shook her head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, he’s left Trap’s,” Michael said. “I went in
there just now and inquired for him. They said he departed
the day after he came and they don’t know anything
about him. Didn’t leave any address or say where
he was going.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then he never got his letter back,” I said. “It must
be at the Inn now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, it isn’t, I’ve got it in my pocket. I just told old
man Trap that a friend of mine had mailed a letter to
him and that, as long as they didn’t know where he
was, I thought this person would like to have it back.
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>So he just handed it out without a word and here
it is.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I’m glad you got it,” exclaimed Eve. “For after
what Captain Trout told us this afternoon, I can’t help
thinking maybe it is important.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So you’ve been talking to the Captain?” Michael
queried.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, you see it was Daisy June’s doing,” Eve began.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The kitten you left on our doorstep this morning,”
I put in. “That was a marvelous idea of yours, Michael!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say, did it work?” he demanded eagerly. “Did your
aunt really take to it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aunt Cal? Not on your life! It was Captain Trout.
We left Daisy June asleep on his knee with every appearance
of being settled for life. And when Adam saw
her, he just walked out—came back to us!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael threw back his head and roared. We went
on to tell him what Captain Trout had told about Judd
Craven and the blue emerald. He nodded, “I guess
everybody around here has heard of old Captain Judd,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But Aunt Cal has never mentioned him to us,” I
said. “Though I did fancy she looked sort of funny
the other day when we told her about being locked in
the old house. I expect maybe she knows it well.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wills make a lot of trouble, don’t they?” I went
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>on. “Whether one makes one or doesn’t, it seems to be
always the same. Bad feeling of some kind.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael grinned at this. “Well, what would you do
about it?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I don’t know. I guess maybe it’s better not to
have anything to leave when you die. Then your relatives
and friends will go on loving you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yeah, or forget you entirely,” he retorted cynically.</p>

<p class='c010'>We had been climbing the hill as we talked and had
come once more to the tumbling stone wall which
bordered the Craven property. We climbed over it and
made our way through the tall grass and bushes to the
spot where we had found Mr. Bangs and his measuring
tape two weeks before. The grass was considerably
trampled around the stone figure but, at first glance,
that was the only sign that anybody had been near the
spot.</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael dropped on his knees and at once set to work
examining the ground. Presently he took a tape measure
from his pocket and began measuring. “You look,”
remarked Eve, “quite like Mr. Bangs himself, except
that you’ve got more hair on your head.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael paid no attention. He measured thirteen feet
and six inches south from the statue. Then, turning
west at a right angle, counted off another seven feet.
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>“There,” he exclaimed at last, “that ought to be the spot,
if any!”</p>

<p class='c010'>We were kneeling beside him now, all three of us,
bent eagerly over the matted grass. Suddenly Michael’s
finger dug into the earth and he lifted bodily forth a
big square of ragged turf. “Why!” I stammered, “how
queer!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Golly!” cried Eve. “He’s dug here already! We—we’re
too late!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mean he fitted the turf back like that to cover
his tracks?” I cried with rising indignation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Looks like it,” returned Michael, gazing down at the
newly disturbed earth. “Naturally he didn’t want to
leave traces of his operations for anyone to see. Especially
after you two came spying on him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The old villain! What right has he got to Captain
Judd’s treasure, I’d like to know!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael looked up with his quizzical grin. “Did you
really expect to find treasure buried here?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“W-well,” I stammered, somewhat embarrassed by
the amusement in his gray eyes. “After what Captain
Trout told us—I mean about the blue emerald and
all——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, that!” returned Michael scornfully. “That story
sounds pretty fishy to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But there must have been something here,” put in
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>Eve. “Or else Mr. Bangs wouldn’t have been carrying
around those measurements and all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you didn’t believe there was anything, why did
you bother to come up here and look?” I demanded a
little hotly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well,” he returned slowly, “I was curious to know
what the fellow was up to for one thing. Then,” he
grinned again, “I knew you girls wouldn’t sleep nights
till you’d had a look.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, is that so!” I retorted haughtily. “Of course,
we’re just a couple of weak, credulous females——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael paid no heed to my ill temper. He had drawn
the letter out of his pocket and was studying it. “I’d
give a lot,” he remarked, “to know who wrote this!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What I can’t understand,” mused Eve, “is this: why,
if Mr. Bangs found what he was after, was he so anxious
to get the letter back? Anxious enough, in fact, to break
into Aunt Cal’s house last night to look for it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael shot her an approving glance. “That’s just
the point that has me guessing,” he said. “It rather
looks to me as if the fellow’s excavations didn’t prove
successful after all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But he had the measurements right—we’ve proved
that, haven’t we?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael nodded. He seemed to be thinking deeply.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly Eve got up and wandered over to the
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>blackened stone figure. She stood with her back to us
for several minutes, examining it. At last she turned
around. “Suppose,” she said slowly, looking down to
where Michael and I were sitting, our backs propped
against the bowl of the fountain, “suppose this isn’t
the statue of Circe after all!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What!” Michael was on his feet like a flash. “I say,”
he cried, “that’s an idea! Maybe the old fellow got the
wrong statue!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You see,” went on Eve, “Captain Trout told us
there were several statues which Captain Judd brought
home from his travels. He said there was one of Diana
and one of Mercury. And this statue, even though it is
so dingy and weatherbeaten, looks to me a lot more like
Mercury than anyone else. Look, you can see the places
where the wings were broken off on his back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gee, Eve, you’re dead right!” Michael cried appreciatively.
“Pretty dumb of me not to notice that myself!”
It was the first time that Michael had addressed
either of us directly by our first names. I felt that it was
a tribute to Eve’s intelligence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We simply took it for granted that it was the right
statue,” Eve continued. “And, of course, our friend
Bangs couldn’t be expected to know a great deal about
mythology. I suppose one statue looks pretty much like
another to a fellow like him.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>“Then the thing to do,” I burst in excitedly, “is to
find the right one—the missing Circe! She surely must
be somewhere around.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The garden, as I have said, was so overgrown with
weeds, tall grass, rambling rosebushes and every other
variety of shrub that the space around the fountain
where Mr. Bangs had made his measurements was practically
the only clear spot in sight. But we now set to
work to make a thorough search of the entire place. But
though we combed it from one end to the other, startling
toads from their lairs and stirring up swarms of
mosquitoes, we found not the slightest trace of any other
statue.</p>

<p class='c010'>We were so absorbed in our search that none of us
had noticed the swiftly darkening sky till Eve exclaimed
suddenly, “Goodness, it’s going to rain.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure is,” Michael agreed, emerging from a thicket
of blackberry bushes, with a scratch across one cheek.
“Guess Circe’ll have to stay wherever she’s hiding for
tonight. I’ll run on ahead and get the wagon and meet
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The drops were already beginning to fall before we
reached him. “Better get in behind,” he ordered, “and
put this blanket over your heads.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was pouring by the time we reached Fishers Haven.
Michael did not let us out at the farmhouse as he had
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>done before but drove on to Aunt Cal’s gate. There was
no time for any further plans that night. We just called
out our thanks and made a dash for the house. But I
was sure that Michael would not be satisfied until he
had fathomed the mystery of the old garden, whatever
it was. For my own part, I was determined to go back
and continue the search at the earliest possible moment.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>The</span> morning mail brought a letter from Hattie
May. Eve was busy spreading carpet rags on
the tin roof of the porch outside our bedroom
window. We had forgotten and left them in the side
yard and, as it had rained practically the entire night,
the results can be imagined. Our only hope now was
that the warm sun would dry them before Aunt Cal
discovered what had happened.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eve,” I called, “here’s a letter from Hattie May.
What do you think it says!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve poked her head in at the window. “I think the
colors are really going to be improved,” she said. “The
fading has made them softer, sort of artistic looking.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Maybe,” I agreed, “though I doubt if Aunt Cal will
appreciate the effect! But don’t you want to know what
Hattie May says? Aren’t you at all curious?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>“Nothing sensible, I’ll be bound. What’s she up to
now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She’s coming here!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What! Not to Fishers Haven?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yup. She wants to help us solve the mystery, she
says.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve climbed into the room. “Sandy,” she demanded
sternly, “what have you been writing her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, nothing. I thought she ought to know that
our vacation wasn’t promising to be as dull as she had
prophesied, so I just mentioned a thing or two—guardedly,
of course.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Too guardedly, I guess,” Eve retorted. “She probably
thinks there’s a lot more to it than there is!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But isn’t there?” I asked. “I mean to say, we don’t
know yet what there is to it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sandy, you know perfectly well that Hattie May
can’t keep even the tiniest secret five minutes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, she’s coming anyway and it’s too late to head
her off. And that isn’t all,” I giggled. “She’s bringing
Hamish with her—or rather he’s bringing her. Seems
he’s got a car.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not—not that boy with the sticky-out ears! Not actually!”
Eve dropped onto the sea chest, consternation
in every line of her face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yup, they’re driving up from Mason’s Cove, wherever
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>that is. It appears their family is spending the summer
there. They’re going to stay at a hotel or inn or
whatever there is, Hattie May says. She says her parents
consented because she told them my father was a missionary,
so they’re sure we’re respectable.” I gave another
giggle.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve groaned. “No doubt their parents are only too
pleased to lose sight of Hamish for a while,” she remarked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh,” I returned lightly, “I can imagine worse boys
than Hamish.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I haven’t your imagination,” Eve returned
feelingly. “When did you say they were coming?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, the letter says tomorrow. But as it isn’t dated
and the postmark is blurred, it might be they’ll be here
today.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Today! Well you’d better go down and break the
news to your aunt!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I don’t see why that’s necessary—they won’t
bother her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t be too sure,” returned Eve darkly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Cal departed soon after dinner that day to attend
the weekly meeting of the Ladies’ Civic Betterment
Society. The carpet rags were all dry and Eve and
I determined to get a lot of sewing done on them to
make up for our carelessness in leaving them out in
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>the rain. Eve thought that, once they were sewed and
wound into balls, Aunt Cal might not notice the change
in color which many of the pieces had undergone.</p>

<p class='c010'>We established ourselves in the shade of the side yard.
Adam came and stretched himself in the sun nearby.
He had shown no desire to leave the premises since
Daisy June had taken up her residence next door and
had manifested considerable irritation that morning
when the kitten had pounced at his tail from underneath
the hedge.</p>

<p class='c010'>We were discussing what we now termed The Craven
House Mystery as we did much of the time when we
were alone. We could not decide what we ought to do
with the old letter which Michael had returned to us.
“Well, whatever you do, don’t show it to Hamish or
Hattie May,” Eve was saying. And it was just at that
moment that I looked up and saw a green roadster
drawing up at the gate. I knew at once by the frantic
waving of the girl beside the driver that it was Hattie
May. “There they are!” I cried, jumping to my feet.
“Come on, Eve!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Sandy, darling, it seems perfect months since I
saw you!” Hattie May threw herself upon me in her
usual effusive manner. Her brother, climbing out of
the other side of the car, was peering around with small
bright eyes behind thick glasses, as if he fairly expected
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>some mysterious phenomenon to develop right there
before his eyes!</p>

<p class='c010'>“I say,” he demanded without the formality of greeting,
“have you seen the fellow who wears a wig again?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes, do tell us all the latest developments!”
Hattie May cried. “I can hardly wait to hear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Bangs has left town,” replied Eve coldly. “And
nothing more has happened. I’m really afraid you’re
going to be disappointed, Hattie May, if you think anything
is going to. I’m afraid Sandy has given you a
wrong impression—this isn’t like a mystery thriller, you
know!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But my dear,” my roommate exclaimed, “surely there
is some treasure buried in that old garden. What else
<i>could</i> that cryptic message mean? Tell me, haven’t you
found a thing?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Well, I guess we both saw that there was nothing for
it but to tell them everything. If we didn’t, Hattie May
would begin to imagine all sorts of startling things that
weren’t so, and might even end in blurting out something
and getting us in bad with Aunt Cal.</p>

<p class='c010'>So we all repaired to the side yard and sat down on
the grass. And while Eve went inside for cold tea and
cookies, I told Hattie May and her brother briefly just
how far we had got—or hadn’t got, rather—in unravelling
the mystery and how we had gone about it.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>Hattie May, as was to be expected, kept interrupting
and asking all sorts of foolish questions. Hamish said
nothing at all but his eyes were very bright and eager
as he listened. When I had finished, he got up. “Well,”
he said, “I guess I’d better go right out there and have
a look round.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I suppressed a giggle. The pride of Scotland Yard,
called in as a last resort, to solve a baffling crime, couldn’t
have spoken with more importance! “But gracious,
Hamish,” I exclaimed, “there’s nothing to see!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just let me have a look at that letter,” he continued,
“so’s I’ll get the measurements straight.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve came out with the refreshments. “Hamish,” I
said, with I fear, a trace of sarcasm, “is going right out
to dig up the treasure!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’ll have to wait for me,” declared his sister. “I’m
going to have some tea first.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish’s eyes lighted on the cookies. “Oh, well,” he
said and sat down.</p>

<p class='c010'>It ended finally in our producing the letter and then
all piling into the car and driving out to Craven House.
Neither Eve nor I was willing to let Hattie May and,
her brother go without us. But I did wish that Michael
were along, somehow it seemed his affair as much
as ours.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hattie May went into ecstasies over the house and,
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>most of all, over the garden. “My <i>dear</i>,” she cried, “I
think it is absolutely the most romantic place. Can’t you
just see that old miser bringing his gold and jewels out
here on a dark night——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But he wasn’t a miser,” I protested. “And he didn’t
have any gold.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nonsense, you needn’t tell me,” she retorted. “He
buried something, didn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, we don’t actually know——” I began, but
Hattie May had disappeared after Hamish into a thick
growth of underbrush.</p>

<p class='c010'>For my own part, the old garden had never appeared
so thoroughly unattractive as it did today. It was very
hot in the mid-afternoon sun and heavy with the scent
of overgrown vegetation. I sat down on the edge of
the fountain and tried to imagine what it had been like
in the old days, the days when Captain Judd had taken
such pride in it and folks had driven from all around
in their buggies to see the funny statues he had brought
from over the sea. I tried to see it with the paths and
flower beds that were now almost entirely lost to view.
I wondered what the Captain’s wife had been like,
the woman called Emily, who hated the sea. Had she
loved the flowers and tended them as Aunt Cal would
have done?</p>

<p class='c010'>Then I fell to thinking of Aunt Cal and wondering
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>what she would have done to the place had it fallen to
her. I could fancy how she would have enjoyed scrubbing
and painting the house and putting it in order
again. And the garden—I smiled to myself when I
thought of my indomitable relative coming to grips
with that garden.</p>

<p class='c010'>Meanwhile the others were wandering about, poking
into every niche and corner for some trace of the missing
statue. I believe Hattie May had expected to discover it
almost at once and I could see that she was considerably
crestfallen when she at last returned to join me at the
fountain. “It’s very baffling!” she sighed, wiping her
burning face. “If we could only find the pedestal where
the thing stood, that would be enough.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish did not give up easily. But at last we persuaded
him to abandon his efforts for the time being, for as Eve
pointed out there was really no fear that Mr. Bangs
would get ahead of us so long as the Circe was missing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Unless,” said Hamish astutely, “he has taken it away
on purpose!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t mean you think he has stolen the statue?”
cried his sister. “Why should he do that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To keep anyone else from finding the treasure of
course, stupid. It looks to me as if we were up against
a very clever crook!”</p>

<p class='c010'>I giggled. “Oh, don’t be absurd,” I said. “Mr. Bangs
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>doesn’t know we’re interested in his search—why should
he? And if he knew where Circe was, he’d go ahead and
dig and find out what there was to find.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish however clung to his theory. It was the only
explanation, he said, for the absence of the statue. As we
were packing ourselves into the car for the return trip
the rattle of a wagon sounded up the road and Michael
drove into view. Eve called to him and at the mention of
his name, Hattie May was out of the car with a bounce.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh,” she cried, “I’ve been wanting so much to meet
you! Ever since I heard how you chased that desperate
villain the other night! I think you were absolutely the
bravest thing!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael’s face assumed its stoniest aspect. I feared that
he and Hattie May were not going to get along. “We’ve
been looking about the garden again,” Eve said hurriedly
to fill up the awkward pause. “But we didn’t find
anything.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael nodded. “Guess there’s nothing to find,” he
remarked noncommittally. With that he gathered up the
reins and drove on.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I must say he’s a queer acting boy!” Hattie
May exploded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You shouldn’t have gushed over him,” Eve said. “He
doesn’t like that sort of thing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The car was bumping down the road now. We passed
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>Michael on the way, but he didn’t look around. Hattie
May and her brother engaged rooms at Wildwood
Lodge, a quiet little inn on the shore road. That and the
big Seaside Hotel farther down the beach were the only
accommodations Fishers Haven offered to summer
guests.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve and I were late for supper. Aunt Cal was pouring
her second cup of tea when we came in. We told her
about the arrivals and added casually that we’d been for
a drive in Hamish’s car.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A boy of that age has no business with a car,” Aunt
Cal stated severely. “First thing you know you’ll be in
one of those accidents the papers are full of. In my day
young folks didn’t go careering around the country!”</p>

<p class='c010'>As if he realized that his reputation was at stake,
Hamish himself reappeared directly after supper. We
heard the already familiar honk of his horn as we were
finishing the dishes and a moment later, his bespectacled
face appeared at the screen door. “Is your aunt in?” he
demanded. “I’ve brought her a little present.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She’s in the garden,” I answered. “Just a minute and
I’ll take you out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But he did not wait for me to take off my apron.
“I’ll find her,” he called and was striding down the
path. Eve giggled. “I warned you,” she said, “how
things would be if that boy came to town.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>I wasn’t present at the meeting of my relative and
Hamish. By the time we reached the spot where Aunt
Cal and Adam were sitting, the moment for introductions
had passed. Hamish had just pulled a queer looking
package out of his side pocket and was proffering it
to my aunt. “Here’s a little gadget I picked up on my
way down today,” he remarked. “I said to myself as
soon as I saw it that it was a thing any good house-keeper’d
like to own.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Cal, apparently stunned by the quick movement
of events, took the parcel without a word and began
unwrapping it. “It’s a combination mousetrap and insect
sprayer,” Hamish explained. “A new invention, just
on the market.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear me,” said Aunt Cal, turning it over. “You don’t
say. Much obliged, I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Glad you like it,” returned Hamish complacently.
“Thought you would. What a handsome cat!” He
stooped to give Adam’s back a rub.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Adam—perhaps resenting the mousetrap—got up
and with a backward swish of his tail, started up the
path.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here, kitty, kitty!” Hamish pulled a length of twine
from his pocket and began dangling it before the cat’s
nose. As he did so a piece of paper fluttered to the
ground, unseen by him as he walked away.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>I recognized it instantly and stooped to grab it. But
Aunt Cal was nearest and reached it first. Papers scattered
about her garden were not to be endured even for
a second. She was about to crumple it in her hand when
her eyes fell on the handwriting. In an instant I saw
her face change. She was staring hard at the paper and
the hand which held it was shaking. “Wh-what is this?”
she demanded in a hard strained voice.</p>

  <h2 id='ch12' class='c014'>XII<br /> <br />Over the Banister</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>When</span> Aunt Cal saw that letter and I watched
that funny, almost frightened look pass over
her face, I knew of course that there was
nothing for it but to tell her everything. But I never am
good in a crisis and this time was no exception. Aunt
Cal had picked up the paper, as I have said, and now sat
staring at it just exactly as if she were seeing a ghost.
“What is this?” she demanded again, and this time I
knew that somebody had to answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a paper we found in that suitcase,” I began. “I
mean it dropped out when we opened it to look for an
address and found all those bottles and afterward it got
under the bed somehow but as we had returned it by
this time—though of course we could tell by the smell
where it had come from——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear Sandra,” Aunt Cal had regained some of
her composure in the face of my stumbling recital, “I
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>am sure that I find myself quite unable to follow you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps I’d better tell it,” Eve put in quietly. Whereupon
she gave Aunt Cal the facts as they had happened
in a few words, including the evening visit of the
mysterious Mr. Bangs on the night when Aunt Cal had
been absent in Old Beecham. Eve made no mention,
however, of what Captain Trout had told us of Aunt
Cal’s own connection with the Cravens, nor of the blue
emerald. But she did tell about our search for the missing
statue.</p>

<p class='c010'>When she had finished I waited breathlessly for what
Aunt Cal would say. Would she be very angry with
us for keeping all this from her? But I was to realize
anew that evening that it was part of my aunt’s code
of life to conceal her emotions. And her only comment
when Eve had ended her recital was, “So that explains
the condition of my bureau drawers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But we put everything back just——” I was protesting
when a look from Eve silenced me.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We expected to tell you all about everything,” she
said, “just as soon as we found out something definite.
You see we—we were afraid you wouldn’t like to have
us go out there at all if you knew—about Mr. Bangs
being a housebreaker and all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are quite correct in that,” returned my aunt
severely. “After all I am responsible for your safety.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>“But of course now,” I put in anxiously, “now that he
has left, it is different—I mean it can’t do any harm just
to go out and—and look around, I mean——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I doubt if your investigations will lead you anywhere,”
she returned frostily. “And now if you have
quite finished with your extraordinary revelations, I
think I will go in. Here in the country as you know”—she
looked pointedly at Hamish—“we are accustomed
to retire early.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Well so much for Aunt Cal’s connection with the
mystery, I thought, as we sat in silence and watched
her spare, uncompromising figure with Adam closely
at heel disappear inside the kitchen door. Hamish, who
had kept silence for a longer period than I would have
deemed possible, now let out an explosive “Whew!”
And added gloomily, “And she went and left my
present behind!” It was true; the combination mousetrap
and insect sprayer still lay in its wrappings on the
bench. But the letter was gone!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never mind, Hamish,” I said consolingly. “I think
Aunt Cal really was upset you know, though she didn’t
show it. I’m sure nothing but great stress of mind
would have made her forget your lovely present!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, maybe,” he returned. “I suppose I’d better be
going. Glad I made a copy of that letter though!”</p>

<p class='c010'>So Hamish had copied the “cryptic message” too.
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>Well, there were plenty of copies going around. Eve
had one, and now Hamish, and I would not have been
surprised if Michael—for all his seeming indifference—had
one too. Besides that, Mr. Bangs apparently had
the measurements in his head, as he had proved. At
this rate, all Fishers Haven might soon be in the secret
of the whereabouts of Captain Judd’s treasure.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eve,” I said, after we had locked the back door and
gone up to bed, “do you think Aunt Cal will do anything?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve shook her head slowly. “I can’t make her out,”
she said. “I’m as sure as anything that she recognized the
handwriting on that paper but that’s absolutely all I
am sure of. If Hamish thought he had pulled a coup,
he jolly well must have been disappointed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What?” I demanded. “You mean Hamish dropped
that letter on purpose?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why of course he did,” returned Eve. “He wanted
Aunt Cal to see it; he thought he’d find out something.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But,” I protested indignantly, “didn’t we practically
swear both him and Hattie May to secrecy before we
showed it to them!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They agreed not to say anything. They didn’t agree
not to drop things around apparently by accident.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That Hamish!” I cried; “somebody ought to—to sit
on him so hard—well hard enough to make him yell.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>“I warned you there’d be trouble,” said Eve, “just as
soon as Hattie May put her nose into this business.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I was just ready for bed when I found that I had left
my wristwatch downstairs on the kitchen shelf. Slipping
into my bathrobe, I was about to steal down after
it when I was surprised to see a light coming from the
front room below stairs. Had Aunt Cal gone down
again, I wondered—or was this another evening visitor?</p>

<p class='c010'>For a second I hesitated there on the top step. If it
was Aunt Cal I’d better not go down, but if it was somebody
else—Mr. Bangs perhaps, returned to make another
search for his missing property——. The thought
sent me creeping forward. My slippered feet didn’t make
a sound on the carpeted stairs. Over the banister I now
had a clear view into the lighted room below, and there,
seated at the old-fashioned secretary in the corner, was
Aunt Cal. The desk was open and spread with papers—letters
by the look. And I had no doubt that Mr. Bangs’
mysterious document was among them.</p>

<p class='c010'>As quietly as I had descended, I stole back to our room
and told Eve what I had seen. “I think she’s comparing
the handwriting with some she’s got, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps,” Eve agreed. “I do hope she isn’t awfully
upset by it all,” she added. “If I thought we’d been the
means of worrying her or anything, I’d be sorry we ever
found that letter, Sandy. I really would.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>“Yes—of course,” I agreed. “Still we weren’t really
responsible for finding it—it isn’t as if we had meant
to take it. And anyhow maybe some good will come of
it; you can’t tell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you mean finding treasure,” Eve shook her head.
“No, I’m inclined to agree with Michael about that.
Don’t forget,” she added wisely, “that we’re living in
the twentieth century!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No-o, I won’t,” I said with a sigh. “Very likely you’re
right, Eve—very likely we’d better just drop the whole
thing, forget about it entirely. Still—there’s the letter!
People don’t write down measurements, do they, unless
there’s something to measure?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Or unless they want to fool somebody!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fool somebody?” Oh, that was a disconcerting
thought! But fool who? Mr. Bangs, or Aunt Cal—or
us? No, the last two possibilities were absurd. For our
own possession of the letter had been purely accidental,
as, for the matter of that, was Aunt Cal’s. The more
I though of it in the light of Eve’s rather startling suggestion,
the more confused I became. And it was perhaps
no wonder that, falling asleep at last, I should dream that
Daisy June’s eyes had turned into blue emeralds but
that, when I put out my hand to take them, it was
Adam’s green ones which I found coldly regarding me.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>Aunt Cal</span> was as brisk and decisive as ever next
morning. She made no mention of last evening’s
occurrences, but she startled us by proposing
a plan. “How would you like to have a picnic
for your two friends this afternoon?” she asked. “I’m
told the young people often go to the beach and cook
their supper over an open fire, though I must say it has
always seemed to me a most unsatisfactory way of preparing
a meal.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, a beach picnic!” I cried. “What a perfectly swell
idea!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you’ll come too, Aunt Cal?” Eve begged.</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Cal shook her head. “I’m obliged to go into Millport
this afternoon on some business,” she said. “But I
shall be able to help you with your preparations this
morning if you think favorably of my suggestion.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bet your life we do!” I jumped up and gave her a
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>hug. “Oh, Aunt Cal, you are a darling after all—I mean,”
I amended hastily, “after all the trouble and worry we’ve
caused you. I’ll go call up Hattie May right away!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, you’d better,” Eve agreed, “before that Hamish
goes off on some wild goose chase or other. When a boy
imagines he’s been endowed by a beneficent providence
with the mental equipment of a Sherlock Holmes, you
can’t tell what he may do!”</p>

<p class='c010'>I returned from the drug store to find Eve stirring a
cake and Aunt Cal making salad. “They’re coming,” I
announced, “at least Hattie May is. Hamish has gone off
somewhere but she said he’d promised to be back for
lunch.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I only hope you won’t set yourselves afire,” said
Aunt Cal with a sigh. “Or catch your death o’ cold
sitting around in those awful bathing suits!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hattie May says we can dress in the Wildwood Inn
pavilion,” I said. “And don’t forget we’ll have Hamish
on hand in case of accidents!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve was putting the finishing touches to the chocolate
cake some time later. As she stood surveying its satiny
perfection, she said slowly, “I do wish Michael Gilpatrick
could taste that. I’d like to show him that a mere girl is
good for something! Besides, I hate to think of Hamish
practically gobbling up the whole thing as he’s sure to
do if he doesn’t have a competitor to prevent him.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>“Well you don’t need to worry,” I said. “Because I
invited Michael to come too.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What! You did!” Eve was surprised.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. I thought we might as well ask him. I got hold
of him at the farm in Old Beecham where he works.
He didn’t go into ecstasies over the idea but he said he
was planning to go for a swim this afternoon anyway, as
it’s Saturday half holiday, so I guess maybe he’ll show
up. I only hope he and Hattie May won’t come to blows.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As soon as our rather hurried dinner was over, Aunt
Cal, arrayed in her second best black silk, departed for
Millport. Although she reiterated her warnings against
fire and drowning, I felt somehow that her mind was
preoccupied. Indeed she had been vaguely different all
day. She seemed in a way softened, and yet more determined.
Was that old letter responsible for the change
and was it that which was taking her to Millport?</p>

<p class='c010'>Hattie May and Hamish were waiting on the beach
when we got there that afternoon. Hamish wanted to
know at once whether Aunt Cal had said anything more
about the letter. I told him shortly that she had not. I
felt that he deserved a snubbing for what he had done
last evening but, as often happens, the people whom you
most wish to snub are the very ones who are impervious
to such tactics.</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael was late in arriving. Hattie May said that
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>for her part it didn’t matter whether he came or not as
she’d never met a ruder boy. I thought it a good moment
to put in a word of warning. “Michael is different from
most boys,” I said. “He doesn’t like to be made a fuss
about.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, I just said I thought he was brave in grappling
with that burglar,” Hattie May retorted indignantly.
“Though now that I come to think it over, I quite see
that there was probably no danger at all and that he was
just trying to show off.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Show off!” This indignantly from Eve. “I tell you
Michael’s not that kind.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, you needn’t tell me,” retorted Hattie May. “I
guess I know all about boys.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When at last Michael’s tall figure came sauntering
down the beach, Hattie May greeted him with a chilly
nod. “We thought probably it was milking time and
you wouldn’t be able to get away,” she said casually.</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael grinned. Apparently he had decided that
Hattie May was not to be taken seriously. “Oh, no,” he
said, “we don’t milk till seven. Guess you’ve never lived
on a farm.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” said Hattie May, “I must admit I’ve never had
that pleasure. None of my family are farmers!”</p>

<p class='c010'>This did not seem to be a very auspicious beginning
for our picnic. Eve threw herself into the breach. “Do
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>let’s get into the water,” she urged, “before it gets any
later.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael, as one might have guessed, proved to be by
far the best swimmer of us all, though Eve was a good
second. Hattie May’s efforts were punctuated by blood
curdling screams and calls for somebody to “save her”;
but as no one paid the slightest attention, she soon gave
up and returned to land. Hamish, too, after paddling
about rather blindly without his spectacles, sat down
on the sand where, replacing his glasses on his dripping
countenance, he began making entries in a notebook.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it, Hamish?” I inquired. “Your diary or
memoirs or something?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He shook his head absently. “No, just bringin’ my
notes on the Craven case up to date.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I raised myself on my elbow and looked at him. Was
he just a rather overgrown little boy playing at being
detective? Or had he really found out something of
importance? Suddenly he fixed me with his thick
lenses. “I know what you think,” he said astutely. “You
think I’m one of those playboy detecitifs like in the
books!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, no, indeed,” I assured him hastily. “Of course
I don’t think anything of the kind!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, you do,” he stated. “But I’m not, I’m different.
I figure things out. I’m smart. I got ideas.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>“I’m sure you have,” I murmured, and waited for
what I hoped was coming. But Hamish just went on
writing. At any rate he was keeping his own counsel
in the approved manner of the perfect sleuth.</p>

<p class='c010'>The day was perfection and, as I lay there on the
warm sand and gazed out over the blue bay with its
flecks of white where it met the sea, the question of why
someone had written something in an old letter grew
suddenly unimportant in the face of that bigger wonder
of earth and sea and sky. Then I fell to remembering
another blue bay on the other side of the world across
which I had sailed away from Mother and Dad nearly
a year ago.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sandy’s being homesick!” Eve’s mellow voice broke
into my thoughts.</p>

<p class='c010'>I sat up. “No such thing!” I declared stoutly. “I was
just thinking that a blue emerald couldn’t hold a candle
to the color of that water out there!”</p>

<p class='c010'>I caught a glint of appreciation in Michael’s eyes as
he stood with the shallow water swirling about his
ankles. But Hamish said, “Guess you wouldn’t talk like
that if you should see it once! Chap I talked to this
morning said it was as big as a quarter!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What!” exclaimed Hattie May. “Why, Hamish, you
never told me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Had this chap seen the blue emerald?” Eve inquired.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>“Well, no, not exactly. But he’d heard his folks talk
about it when he was a youngster.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So far as I can discover,” said Eve, “no one ever did
see the thing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose you’ll be saying next that Captain Judd
himself never saw it,” remarked Hattie May. “I suppose
he was maybe blind when he buried it!” she added with
heavy sarcasm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We don’t know that he did bury it,” I remarked. I
glanced at Michael for confirmation, but he only
shrugged and grinned and said he was going up to
dress.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wait,” I said, “I’m going to take some pictures first.”
Some impulse—for which I was later to thank my lucky
stars—had moved me to bring along my kodak. I took
several groups and Eve took some more with me in
them. Then I finished off the film with some snaps
of a fleet of little yachts that were just entering the
harbor. Michael said it was the annual cruise of a Boston
yacht club and that they came into the harbor every
year at this time.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I used to get a great kick out of them when I was
a youngster and first started coming here,” he said. “I
was sure I’d be a skipper when I grew up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why,” exclaimed Eve, “I thought you were a native
of Fishers Haven, Michael. Weren’t you born here?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>“Oh, no, my home’s in Connecticut. My folks used
to come here for summer vacations. So this summer
when I had to get some work, I came up and got me
a job on Cousin Al’s farm.”</p>

<p class='c010'>After we had dressed we all set to work on preparations
for supper. The boys built an oven in the sand
while we collected firewood. Then we buried potatoes
to bake and sharpened long sticks for roasting bacon
over the coals. Eve and Hattie May and I made coffee
and spread the table.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why didn’t your aunt come to the picnic?” Hamish
asked unexpectedly, while we all sat about waiting for
the potatoes to get done.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, picnics aren’t in her line I guess,” I said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you suppose she <i>ever</i> went to one—when she
was a girl, I mean?” asked Hattie May.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t know, I’m sure,” I found it hard somehow
to think of Aunt Cal as a girl at all.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I’ll bet that old salt next door has been to
plenty of ’em,” said Hamish. “I’ll bet he hasn’t missed
much that went on, picnics or anything else!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael chuckled. “You should hear the sea yarns he
can tell when he gets going!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By the way,” continued Hamish casually, “I picked
up a little present for him when I was over in Millport
this morning, something practical and yet fancy.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>“A present for Captain Trout!” We all gazed with
curiosity as Hamish proceeded to extract from the
pocket of his jacket an oblong package.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hamish,” giggled Eve, “is the world’s great gift
giver. He just showers tokens of esteem about among
his acquaintances. He hasn’t given me anything yet but
I’m living in hopes. By the way, when did you get
acquainted with the Captain, Hamish—you only came
yesterday?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well,” he returned, “of course I’m not exactly acquainted
with him. But I noticed him walkin’ round his
garden last night. And so when I came across this—this
present that I got—I thought right away that that
was just what this sailor fellow needed. Even if I don’t
know him, I think we all ought to help each other all
we can.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hamish,” I murmured feelingly, “I never dreamed
what deep springs of unselfishness were—er—slumbering——”
I dabbed at my eye as the smoke from the fire
was drifting my way.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Springs don’t slumber!” put in Eve.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, open it up and do let’s see what fool contraption
you’ve bought now!” demanded Hattie May impatiently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“’Tisn’t either.” Hamish pulled off the string of the
package. “You see, I noticed as soon as I saw this fellow
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>Trout that he was goin’ bald. So naturally when I ran
into a fellow peddlin’ hair tonic——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hair tonic!” came in a chorus from Eve and me.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yup.” Hamish held up a large black bottle. Somehow
I knew what the label would say before I read it—“Harry’s
Hair Restorer”!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hamish,” I demanded tensely, “where did you get
it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, I just been tellin’ you, on the street in Millport.
A fellow was peddlin’ it—said it was his own secret
formula that he’d used for twenty years. And, boy,
you oughta seen his hair!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Golly!” said Michael, swallowing half a sandwich
at a gulp. “Can you beat that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, what’s eatin’ you?” Hamish’s gaze traveled
from him to Eve’s face and mine. “You all look ’sif I’d
committed a crime or sumpin! I guess the stuff isn’t
poison and anyhow nobody’s going to drink it. The
way I figure with a head like Trout’s, anything he can
do—even if it only grows him a couple of hairs—is
better than leavin’ things go the way they are!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look here,” asked Michael. “This fellow you bought
the stuff of, is he still in Millport?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do I know? I didn’t ask him where he was
going. Say, what’s all the excitement anyway?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The excitement is,” I said, “that our Mr. Bangs, in
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>addition to carrying cryptic documents in his suitcase,
also carried a cargo of hair tonic which I guess we forgot
to tell you about—bottles labeled ‘Harry’s Hair Restorer’
and so forth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sufferin’ sunfish! You don’t mean it? Then this guy
is the very same villain that’s been diggin’ up that garden
and that broke into your aunt’s house the other night!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Looks like it,” said Michael. “He must have got
himself another wig somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And me talkin’ to him face to face!” moaned Hamish.
“Just the very man I was lookin’ for! And me falling
for that yarn of his that he’d lost all his hair from
jungle fever when he was twenty-one and how this
restorer had brought it all back in ninety days! Golly,
I could go kick myself into the ocean—him and his
old hair tonic!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He took out the cork from the bottle and sniffed it
disgustedly. “Uh! Smells like glue and kerosene!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let me smell,” said Hattie May.</p>

<p class='c010'>The bottle was passed from one to the other and we
all made faces in turn. As I handed it back to Hamish,
he seized it violently and, rising, with a savage gesture,
flung it into the sea. It fell far out in the green water
with a plump. “I’m goin’ to get even with that fellow,”
he declared dramatically, “if it’s the very last act of my
life—even if it takes me ten years!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>“Poor Captain Trout,” Eve murmured, “destined to
a hairless old age!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish glared at her. “I say,” he demanded, “when
do we start eatin’?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael bent over the oven. “The potatoes are done,”
he announced.</p>

<p class='c010'>While we ate, we continued to discuss the case of
Mr. Bangs. What sort of a man was this? One day
appearing as a real estate agent, another as a burglar
and a third, as a street peddler! And if he had failed to
find what he was after in the old garden, why was he
still hanging about? Were the wigs he wore intended
merely as an advertisement of his wares or were they
worn for disguise?</p>

<p class='c010'>As we talked the sun dropped lower and the slanting
rays turned the blue-green water to rose and gold
and crimson. The waves grew quiet under its gilded
touch. At their moorings, the little yachts rocked gently
with furled sails. For a moment our chatter subsided.
It was Hamish’s falsetto voice that broke the spell.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say, isn’t it about time we got started home? Isn’t
anything more to eat, is there?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“One sandwich left,” I said.</p>

<p class='c010'>He shook his head. “Haven’t got time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Time?” Hattie May cried. “Hamish Farragut Lewis
what are you going to do now?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>“Oh, nuthin’,” he muttered. “Just thought it was
getting pretty late and if I was goin’ to drive the girls
home—on account of their aunt bein’ so particular and
all——”</p>

<p class='c010'>His sister eyed him suspiciously. Apparently this explanation
of his haste did not altogether satisfy her.
However, we began to pack up the things. Michael extinguished
the last remnants of the fire and Hamish
went to get his car.</p>

<p class='c010'>We walked up to the Inn with Hattie May. Hamish
was waiting to drive us home. Michael refused a lift,
saying he had to see a fellow in the village.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now you come right straight back, Hamish,” Hattie
May ordered. “If you don’t, I’m going to write to Mother
first thing in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish’s mutterings were unintelligible as he bent
over the starter.</p>

  <h2 id='ch14' class='c014'>XIV<br /> <br />Sunday</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_8_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>Little</span> did I think that night as I snuggled into my
pillow, trying to find a comfortable spot for my
sunburned shoulder, what momentous events
the coming week held in store.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sunday was quiet enough, however. Eve and I both
overslept but this, Aunt Cal supposed, was no more than
was to be expected after our “dissipation.” She had apparently
forgotten that the dissipation had been her own
suggestion. Indeed her Sunday morning severity seemed
to have quite erased all traces of that softened mood I
had imagined I detected yesterday.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sunday at Aunt Cal’s had its own particular ritual.
Breakfast was half an hour later, a concession to the
day of rest. Or perhaps to keep us from getting too
hungry for the cold dinner which followed church.</p>

<p class='c010'>I enjoyed going to the service in the little white meeting
house with its faintly musty smell, which reminded
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>me somehow of things I had never known but which
seemed curiously a part of me nevertheless. Eve said
it was my New England ancestry coming out. Eve
likes to dwell on the fact that her own ancestors were
among the pioneers who made tracks into the western
wilderness and it is to this fact that she attributes her
own love of change and adventure. Though, as I pointed
out to her, both our family trees probably had their roots
in the same soil—so where was the difference really? It
is a subject we never tire of discussing, that of ancestry
and the chances of life which made us what we are!</p>

<p class='c010'>We were talking about it that morning as we got
ready for church, taking Aunt Cal as an example of
what the past in the shape of tradition and custom
could do for one. Aunt Cal had never spoken of her
family or forbears but I felt practically certain that her
direct ancestral line included a Scotch Covenanter, a
Puritan preacher and one of the judges who sentenced
the Salem witches to be burned!</p>

<p class='c010'>Hattie May was at church in ruffled organdy and a
floppy hat with Hamish, looking very much like a rebellious
little boy in his stiff white collar. I guessed that
his sister had him well in hand for the time at least.</p>

<p class='c010'>As we walked home in the bright midday sun, one on
either side of Aunt Cal, I felt as if I were taking part in
a scene which had happened over and over again. Perhaps
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>not so long ago, Aunt Cal had walked like this
with her mother on Sunday morning.</p>

<p class='c010'>As we approached Captain Trout’s cottage, the Captain
himself, dressed immaculately as usual, rounded
the corner of the house. “Good morning, ladies!” he
swept off his blue visored cap, revealing the shining expanse
of his bald head. “A beautiful day!”</p>

<p class='c010'>We smiled at him but Aunt Cal’s only response was a
stiff inclination of the head. As she was about to sweep
on, however, a light-footed gray form darted from behind
the hedge, made a wild spring into the air and
landed clinging on the fringe of Aunt Cal’s sash.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That miserable cat!” cried the Captain, darting
spryly through the gate. But Eve had the kitten first and
was gently detaching her sharp little claws. The Captain’s
apologies were almost abject.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, no damage, I think.” Aunt Cal, unbending a
little, was smiling in spite of herself. “She seems a very
lively kitten.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Madam, I assure you my life is quite dizzy with keeping
up with her. After—er—my other one——. But you
know how it is—these young things!” He smiled expansively
upon Eve and me. “For all their wild ways,
they do help to keep us young!”</p>

<p class='c010'>To this outburst Aunt Cal’s only response was a murmured
word that she must be getting on. But Eve and
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>I lingered to watch Daisy June who was now half way
up a telegraph pole. “Captain Trout,” asked Eve unexpectedly,
“did you ever happen to know a man by
the name of Bangs? Harry Bangs, I think he is—a
barber or something?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Captain shook his head. “Can’t say that I have.
I’ve met some queer barbers in different quarters of the
globe but I don’t recall any by that name. Is the gentleman
a friend of yours?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, no,” returned Eve hastily. “Not at all. We—just
heard of him. And no doubt that isn’t his real name
anyway!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sandy,” said Eve that afternoon. We were in our
room supposed to be writing letters. But I had finished
mine and Eve said she didn’t believe in making the
Sabbath a day of work. “Sandy, I wish we could take
just one more look for that Circe. I’m not half satisfied
yet that she isn’t somewhere about.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know,” I agreed, “I feel that way too. And if you
can think of any plausible excuse to give Aunt Cal for
our going out there again—you see, now that she knows
about things, she’s pretty sure to keep here eye on us
from now on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve nodded. “Don’t I know it! But I’ve been wondering
if we couldn’t go out and make a call on that
friend of hers in Old Beecham. Mrs. Viner, you know,
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>the one who was sick. Don’t you think we might take
her out—oh, some soup or something? Or just drop in
on her to cheer her up?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Maybe she don’t want to be cheered up,” I said.
“Maybe she enjoys being gloomy like Aunt Cal!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just the same I’m going to suggest it,” returned
Eve. “’Twon’t do any harm to try.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well you’d better wait till tomorrow anyway,” I
said. “I don’t think she’s in a very auspicious mood today.
I guess maybe her trip to Millport yesterday had a bad
effect on her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I was making the bed next morning when Eve came
racing up the stairs. “I’ve done it!” she said, her eyes
dancing. “I asked her wouldn’t she like to have us go
out and inquire about Mrs. Viner as it was such a lovely
cool morning and we’d enjoy the trip.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, she was a little surprised. Guess she suspects
some hidden motive but she did admit that she’d like
to know how Mrs. V. is getting along. So she finally
agreed and said she’d send her a bottle of dandelion
wine. She lives in the big stone house next the feed
store and we’re not to stay more than ten minutes and
not to talk any nonsense.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The shorter, the better for me,” I said. “Invalids
give me the jitters! Make me feel sorta creepy like.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>“Sandy, I’m ashamed of you! And you a missionary’s
daughter!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s that got to do with it? Besides you can’t
pretend that your own—er—motives are purely hu—what
d’you call it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Humanitarian, you mean. Well, what if they’re not!
I guess,” she added sagely, “hardly anybody’s are when
you come right down to it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t know my father,” I said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I said hardly anybody. Anyway don’t let’s
stand here arguing. I guess you can stand a ten minute
call.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But what shall we talk about?” I persisted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh anything—ships or shoes or sealing wax,” she
returned lightly. “Personally I’ve always found shoes
a good subject when hard pressed. Middle-aged people
are practically certain to have foot troubles and they
just dote on telling you about the kind of shoes they
wear and where they got ’em and what a lot they had
to pay!”</p>

<p class='c010'>I giggled. “But if Mrs. Viner’s in bed she won’t be
wearing shoes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I guess she isn’t a permanent invalid. I guess it’ll
work out all right. Now do hurry and get ready so we
can catch the nine-thirty bus. Aunt Cal’s wrapping up
the dandelion wine.”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>Twenty</span> minutes later we set forth. But we had
not reached the corner of Harbor Street before
we ran into Hattie May. She was walking fast
and her face was red. “Why, Hattie May,” I cried, “what
is the matter? Your dress is wrong side out!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hattie May looked vaguely down at the blue print
frock she wore. “Well, it’s no wonder!” she panted. “I
dressed in such a hurry——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But what <i>is</i> the matter?” Eve demanded. “Is it a
fire or something?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It—it’s Hamish,” she cried, still struggling with her
breath. “He—he’s gone!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gone? Gone where?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do I know? If I knew, I wouldn’t be running
round the streets like this, would I?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well do sit down on this horse block,” Eve suggested,
“and tell us what’s happened.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>Hattie sank gratefully down. “Well, all day yesterday,”
she began, “Hamish acted queer!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How d’you mean queer?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well as if he had something on his mind or—or was
planning something. I kept my eye on him all day
because I was suspicious that he was up to something.
I didn’t let him out of my sight a single minute.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Poor Hamish!” I murmured.</p>

<p class='c010'>She turned on me sharply. “Well I’ve got to look after
him, haven’t I? I promised mother. You don’t know
what crazy things Hamish can do!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right,” Eve soothed. “Go on, tell us what happened.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well we went for a little ride after supper. I thought
maybe that would get him calmed down. But he
wouldn’t go far, said he was sleepy and was going to
turn in early. But of course I see now that that was just
a blind—a trick to get me out of the way. If I’d had any
sense, I’d have suspected it at the time. Oh, I’ve been
such a fool!” The last word came out with something
suspiciously like a sob.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I don’t see as you were to blame, Hattie May,”
I said. “Do get on and tell us the rest.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, that’s all! I went into his room this morning
to call him for breakfast and he simply wasn’t there!
His—his bed hadn’t been slept in at all!” she wailed.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>“Gracious,” I exclaimed, “you mean he’d been gone
all night!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hattie May nodded, her lips quivering ominously.
“I—I w-went to the place where he keeps his car and
the man said he’d come back at half past nine last
night and taken it out again and—and they haven’t seen
him since. And now—oh, I don’t know what to do!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why I wouldn’t be so upset, Hattie May,” Eve Said
quietly. “I’m quite sure Hamish is able to take care of
himself, even if he does do queer things. He’s not a
bit stupid, you know. Tell me, haven’t you any notion
where he could have gone—didn’t he drop a hint even?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No. The only thing I can think of is that he went
over to Millport to try to get trace of that terrible villain
who sold him the hair tonic. Ever since he found out
who he was at the picnic Saturday, he’s been funny,
like I told you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” I said, “I remember he said he was going to
get even with him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hamish’s like that,” said his sister. “He can’t bear
to have anyone put anything over on him. I guess maybe
he’s got one of those superior complexions or whatever
you call it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think his complexion is anything remarkable,”
said Eve with a giggle. Then she added
seriously, “But honest, Hattie May, if he’s just gone to
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>Millport, I don’t think there’s anything to worry about.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course not,” I agreed. “Maybe he had a breakdown—I
dare say he’ll turn up any minute.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If it was a breakdown, he could have phoned me,
couldn’t he? I tell you he’s got mixed up with that
awful barber creature somehow. You can’t tell what
may have happened with a man like that—a man that
wears a wig and—and digs up gardens! How do we
know,” she went on wildly, “what he dug that hole for—how
do we know he wasn’t burying a b-bloody weapon
or—or one of his victims!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, for heavens sake, pull yourself together, Hattie
May,” I said with some severity. I knew by experience
that the best way to treat Hattie May when she began
to get hysterical was to scold. If you tried sympathy and
kind words, she just got worse.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” chimed in Eve, “there’s simply no sense in
your going on like this. Nothing has happened to Hamish.
I’d be willing to bet my best embroidered slip on it.
The thing for you to do is to come along with us right
now to Old Beecham to call on a friend of Aunt Cal’s.
And by the time you get back, you’ll very likely find
Hamish eating his dinner at the Inn—see if you don’t.”
Hattie May wiped her eyes on her dress skirt. “I
c-can’t go c-calling in this dress,” she whimpered. “The
s-seams all show! I’d be the laughingstock of Millport.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>“Oh, nobody’s going to notice it,” I said. “All you
have to do is to act as if it was something new from
Fifth Avenue! Come on, we’ll miss the bus if we don’t
hurry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She got up uncertainly. “You don’t think we ought
to go to the Police Station,” she faltered, “and report
Hamish’s disappearance?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t believe there is any,” I said. “Anyway there’ll
be time enough to find out if Hamish isn’t back by
dinner time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I feel all in,” said Hattie May as we hurried her
down the street. “It’s the shock, I suppose. You can’t
think how I felt when I opened Hamish’s door and saw
his bed all smooth and empty. It was just like a murder
story. You know, when the valet goes to call his master
and finds——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, cut it, Hattie May,” Eve ordered. “There’s the
bus—we’d better run!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Fortunately for us the bus was late in leaving, owing
to the fact that one of the passengers was having an
argument with the butcher across the street. We continued
to cheer Hattie May during the short ride to
The Corners. We decided that if Hamish wasn’t back
when we returned, we would get hold of Michael. He
would know what to do and that would be better than
going to the police, because we did not want publicity.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>“Perhaps you’re right,” Hattie May agreed tearfully.
“I’d hate to have anything get into the papers, mother’d
be sure to hear of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, it won’t come to that,” I returned with considerable
more confidence than I felt. For I realized
as his sister had said that with a boy like Hamish you
never could tell what he might do. And I could well
imagine that Mr. Harry Bangs was not one to allow a
boy of fifteen with big ears and a nose for other people’s
business to interfere with his plans.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the bus rolled away and we started on foot up the
hill toward Old Beecham, we told Hattie May of our
plan to stop at Craven House on the way back and take
another look for the missing statue. Hattie May said
she didn’t think she ought to waste time hunting for
lost goddesses when her own brother was missing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She wasn’t a goddess,” I corrected, more for the
sake of making talk than anything else. “She was an
enchantress who turned the companions of Ulysses into
swine by the wave of her wand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, she must have been a very disagreeable person,”
returned Hattie May. “I’m sure I don’t see why
anyone should want a statue of her about!”</p>

<p class='c010'>As we came abreast of the old house, Hattie May
said she’d got to sit down and rest for a minute. The
road was deserted as usual. Beyond the wall the old
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>house seemed asleep. “To think that we almost spent
a night there,” I mused.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll bet you’d have seen a ghost if you had,” said
Hattie May. “I can’t think whatever induced you to go
inside in the first place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That was Eve’s curiosity,” I said. “Without curiosity,
you know, Hattie May, you never get anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve said nothing. She was gazing intently at the
road in front of where we sat. “I didn’t know cars
came out this way much,” she remarked at last.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They don’t,” I said. “That day on the roof we didn’t
see a single one. Michael said there was a better road the
other side of the hill.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But look at those tracks there in the dust,” Eve
said. “It looks as if two or three cars had been out here
recently.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hattie May was on her feet in a flash. “You’re dead
right!” she cried. “A car has turned around right in
front of this house—see the double tracks!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She was right. There were marks of tires going in
both directions clearly discernible in the dry dust of
the road.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Maybe Hamish came out here!” Hattie May cried.
“Maybe he went inside the house and—and—” she cast
terrified eyes beyond the wall.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hush, Hattie May, don’t be ridiculous. There aren’t
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>any such things as ghosts as you very well know. Besides,”
I added illogically, “no one ever heard of one’s
harming a person.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But people die of fright,” Hattie May went on wildly.
“Or—or they fall in a swoon. I’m sure I should if I saw
one and Hamish is a year younger than me. Oh, Eve,
would you dare to—to just go up to the house and—listen?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course I would,” Eve assured her. “What is there
to be afraid of? I’d go inside only the door is locked of
course. But honestly, I don’t believe those tracks mean
a thing—somebody just drove up, discovered he was
on the wrong road and turned around, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Hattie May shook her head. “No. I feel that something
has happened,” she declared solemnly. “I’m as
sure as anything that those marks were made by
Hamish’s car. And,” she flung up her head with a heroic
gesture, “it’s my duty not to leave this place till I’ve
found out—found out what there is to know!”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>We</span> climbed over the wall and made our way
through the tall grass to the rear of the
house. Eve, as good as her word, walked up
to the back door and knocked. Not, she said, that she
expected any answer but just to satisfy Hattie May.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Hattie May did not seem at all reassured by the
silence that answered us. “If Hamish is swooned of—or
d-dead,” she cried, “of course he won’t hear! What
we’ve got to do is to break down that door! Or——”
she glanced helplessly around—“or get inside somehow.
I just know Hamish is somewhere about this place!”</p>

<p class='c010'>I saw that she was on the verge of becoming hysterical
again. “Nonsense,” I said, “if Hamish was here, we’d
have seen his car, wouldn’t we?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can’t help it, I’ve got to get inside,” she repeated,
her voice getting more and more raspy and high-pitched.
“I guess if your only brother was lying——” she paused.
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>Eve who had stopped knocking, now had her hand on
the latch. To our utter amazement it turned in her hand
and the door swung inward. Unlocked! What did that
mean?</p>

<p class='c010'>Well to Hattie May it meant just one thing—a confirmation
of her worst fears. She rushed inside. “Hamish!”
she cried at the top of her lungs. “Hamish, where
are you?” Her voice went echoing through the big
kitchen and the wide hall beyond. But no other sound
answered it. “Hamish! Hamish, where are you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>I was still standing just within the doorway. In truth
I had little desire to enter the house again. Suddenly
Eve who had not moved from the threshold, caught
me by the elbow. “Listen!” she said, “I thought I heard
something!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She had swung round and was gazing out toward the
garden. And as we stood there there came to our ears,
faint and far away, something which sounded like a
muffled cry. Hattie May turned back. “What is it?” she
asked. “What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We thought we heard something outside,” I said.
“Listen, there it is again!” Was it my imagination or was
it a cry for help!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, it’s him—it’s Hamish!” In one dash Hattie May
was through the doorway and running wildly down
the grass grown path toward the garden. “Hamish!
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>Hamish!” she called. And as we sped after her, we heard
the answer again. And this time there was no mistake—“Help,
help!” came the cry!</p>

<p class='c010'>Through the weeds and brambles we streaked,
stumbling over dead branches, scratching faces and
clothes—on and on in the direction of that cry. Hattie
May was in the lead. Once she tripped and fell and Eve
and I had to pull her up. We came to the end of the
garden. Beyond the underbrush was so dense that we
could see nothing ahead. But Hattie May raced on
blindly; her hair streaming about her face, her thin
dress torn; while a trickle of blood from a scratch
across her nose added to the general wildness of her
aspect.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Help, help, help!” The cry was quite near now. We
came to a straggling line of stones where a wall had once
been. On the other side we made out the traces of what
seemed to be the foundation of an old house. The cries
appeared to come from a spot in the undergrowth just
beyond this. Hattie May plowed on, Eve was at her
heels. “Hamish! Where are you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here I am!” It was Hamish’s voice, there was no
mistaking it—but oddly muffled.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly ahead of me I saw Eve pause almost like an
animal who scents danger. “Wait!” she cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Hattie May did not heed. “Hamish,” she repeated
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>frantically, “where are you!” As she spoke I
saw Eve reach out and grab her dress skirt. And she
was just in time. A second later, coming up with them,
I saw that they were standing on the very edge of a
yawning hole. A rotted board half covered it but the
board was broken and showed new splinters as if some
heavy object had but recently fallen through.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a well!” Hattie May cried, dropping to her
knees and peering into the blackness below. “Oh, Hamish,
are you down there--are you drowned?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Get a rope,” came back the voice. “I’m perishin’!
Get a rope and a man quick!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Hamish, are you drowned?” repeated Hattie
May wildly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course he isn’t drowned,” Eve said calmly. “A
drowned person doesn’t scream like that. It’s a dry well,
don’t you understand?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A dry well!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’ve got to get a man and a rope right away,” Eve
went on practically. “I think we’d better go up to the
farm where Michael works, it can’t be far.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hattie May regained some slight semblance of sanity
at this suggestion. “You two go,” she ordered. “I’ll stay
here by Hamish. And oh, do hurry, you can’t tell what
awful things are down that well—snakes and terrible
toads! It must be a mile deep, at least it looks it.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>“I’ll stay with Hattie May,” I said. “You go find
Michael, Eve.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So Eve flew away. Hattie May put her face to the
hole—while I took fast hold on what remained of her
dress—and called down cheering words to the prisoner.
“Eve’s gone for Michael,” she shouted. “He works up
the road. What? What’s that you said?” She lifted her
face from the hole. “Sandy, did you hear that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>I shook my head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He says,” said Hattie May incredibly, “that Michael
is in jail!”</p>

<p class='c010'>I stared at her. “You must have misunderstood,” I
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s what it sounded like. You don’t suppose,” a
new terror was dawning in her eyes, “that being down
there all this time has—has affected Hamish’s mind?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think you misunderstood him,” I repeated soothingly.
“Perhaps he said for Michael to bring a pail.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A pail! Oh, then there must be water in the well
after all! He’s probably caught pneumonia!” She put
her head back to the hole. “Oh, Hamish, are you very
wet?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He says he’s dry as a bone!” she sat up. “He says he’s
got to have a drink right away!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I guess he’ll just have to wait,” I said.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Hattie May’s eyes had lighted on something—a
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>bottle on the ground where Eve had left it. It was the
dandelion wine for Mrs. Viner. She pounced on it. “I’m
going to drop this down!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re crazy, Hattie May!” I protested. “The bottle
will be sure to break or hit him on the head. Besides,”
I added weakly, “very likely he doesn’t like dandelion
wine—many don’t.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How can you talk like that, Sandy, at such a moment!
I guess if your brother was perishing of thirst and
you had some drink to give him—I guess you wouldn’t
hesitate!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well,” I said resignedly, “if you crack his skull, I
don’t think it will help matters any.” But she wasn’t
listening. She was leaning again over the jagged aperture,
the bottle in her hand. I took another strangle hold
on the back of her skirt and held my peace.</p>

<p class='c010'>The bottle disappeared into the void. Just as it did
so, I heard the sound of voices behind me. Michael Gilpatrick
was running toward us and behind him was a
man in blue overalls, carrying a bundle of rope. Panting
in the rear, came Eve.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Michael, I’m glad you’re not—I’m glad you
came!” I cried. He gave me barely a nod. I had never
seen him look so solemn. “How’d he get down there?”
he asked going quickly to the hole and peering down.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We don’t know—we heard him shouting.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>“Oh, do hurry,” urged Hattie May. “He says he’s
perishing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man, whom Michael called Jo, had now come
up, and, without any more words, the two set to work.
We waited breathlessly, Hattie May clinging hard to
my wrist, Eve still panting on the ground at our feet.
There was an endless wait after they let down the rope
while they waited for Hamish to make it fast. Finally
came the call to go ahead, and they began to haul. Inch
by inch, tugging singly and together. The muscles in
Michael’s arms stood out brown and hard; perspiration
streamed from his face; even the burly Jo was gasping.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the moment when her brother’s head appeared
above the hole, Hattie May let out a frightful scream.
I don’t know whether it was just the reaction or the
sight of his straw-colored hair and face plastered with
mud. But she continued to scream until the rescue was
completed and Hamish himself, blinking and tottering
on unsteady feet, stood before us. “Shut up!” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>His sister threw herself upon him. “Oh, Hamish, you
look awful—are you hurt?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael put out a hand to unfasten the rope about
his waist. “He’s okay, aren’t you, Hamish?” he said,
gently pushing Hattie May aside.</p>

<p class='c010'>“An’ fer the love of Mike, how’d you manage to fall
down there?” Jo demanded, curiously surveying him.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>Hamish didn’t answer. He was peering at Michael
through near-sighted eyes—his glasses were gone.
“How’d you get out?” he demanded suddenly.</p>

<p class='c010'>A deeper flush poured over Michael’s hot face. But
he only shrugged. “How long have you been down
there?” he asked in his turn.</p>

<p class='c010'>“All night,” Hamish told him. “And, boy, it was some
night, believe me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It must have been ghastly,” returned Michael. “How
in the world did it happen?”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Hamish announced that he couldn’t say another
word till he’d had a drink. “Didn’t you get the bottle
I threw down?” his sister demanded. His only answer
was a look!</p>

  <h2 id='ch17' class='c014'>XVII<br /> <br />Caught!</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>Back</span> at the house we heard the whole story. The
man Jo had gone back to work but Michael still
lingered. Hamish had taken a long drink of
Craven House well water in bold defiance of Hattie
May’s warning that it was practically sure to be full
of deadly germs; his attitude being, I think, that after
what he’d been through a germ more or less was of
trifling moment. He was seated on an old wooden bench
at the back door. Hattie May had wiped some of the
mud from his face but it still had a grayish unhealthy
cast.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How in the world did you happen to go way out
there?” It was Michael who got the story going.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was on account of those cops,” Hamish said. “I
was tryin’ to get to the place where I’d parked my car
’thout runnin’ into ’em. You see after they got you——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Were you in the house too?” Michael interrupted.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>Hamish shook his head. “No, I was outside but I
heard most everything that went on. I got here ’bout
ten o’clock last night. You see I had kind of a hunch
that that Bangs fellow wasn’t through with the place,
after me runnin’ into him in Millport selling that hair
tonic. I said to myself, ‘He’s still on the trail of sumpin
or I miss my guess.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yeah.” Michael nodded understandingly. “Go on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well I parked my car up the road in that little lane
that runs through somebody’s orchard. Then I came
back here to the house. I hid out in the bushes there to
sort of reconnoiter and I hadn’t been there more’n a
few minutes when sure enough along comes a car. It
stopped down the road a bit and after a while I spied a
man comin’ through the bushes, making for the back
door. I recognized him even though it was dark—it
was Bangs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Hamish, weren’t you scared to death?” cried
Hattie May.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Scared of what?” inquired her brother. “There was
I lyin’ low behind a bush—he hadn’t seen me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, go on,” I urged, “what happened then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well he unlocks the door, goes inside and locks it
after him. ‘All right, mister,’ I says to myself, ‘that’s all
I wanted to know. Now I’ll just buzz over to Millport
and get a cop and you can do some explaining!’”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>Michael grinned wryly. “But you didn’t have to!” he
put in.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gosh no! I hadn’t any more than got to the front
wall creepin’ along so’s not to make a sound when,
boy, ’long comes another car. I guess you know who
that was,” he looked at Michael. “It stopped down the
road about where the first one had, near as I could judge.
Bye and bye I heard voices. I picked me a bush close by
the house and lay down again. The voices got nearer.
One of the fellows had a flash and I saw they were cops,
two of ’em.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Hamish, what did you do then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do? I just lay low and listened. I could hear every
word they said. One of ’em went to the back door and
one to the front. Pretty soon I heard the back door crash
in—that was the husky one did that,” again he looked at
Michael and again, surprisingly, Michael nodded confirmation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well so they got in and I could hear them walkin’
round through the house. Say, get me another drink.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael brought the water. “Oh, do go on,” Hattie
May said impatiently. “What did the villain do when
they got him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish finished the glass of water before he replied.
“They didn’t get him at all,” he said dramatically.
“They got Michael instead! Can you imagine that?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>“Michael!” All of us turned upon the other boy as if
expecting him to deny this astounding statement. But
he only nodded gravely. “But—but I don’t understand,”
Eve cried, “what were you doing in the house?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael gave a shrug. “Oh, it’s just a mess,” he said
gloomily. “The worst I ever got into, I guess. You see
I had the same sort of hunch as Hamish. After he told
of seeing Bangs in Millport, I suspected right away that
he was still hanging around for a reason and that that
reason was somehow connected with this place. I
thought if he did any more digging, he’d probably do
it at night. So I rode out here last night on my bicycle
and climbed into that upstairs window that you girls
left unlocked.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, wasn’t it awfully spooky!” I cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael gave a wry laugh. “No, it was quite peaceful—for
a while. I poked around some with my flash to
make sure the house was empty and then sat down by
the window to wait in case Mr. Bangs should turn up.
Well, everything might have been all right if it hadn’t
been for the fool idea I’d had—” he hesitated, looking
rather sheepish. “Well, you see, I’d had the brilliant
idea of trying to disguise myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Disguise yourself!” Eve cried. “But how?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well I had that wig I’d pulled off Bangs that night
I chased him—I suppose it was that that gave me the
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>idea. I thought it would prevent anyone’s recognizing
me in case I was seen coming in here. So I fixed myself
up with this wig and a straw hat and an old suit of
Al’s. I found an old pair of spectacles around the house
too.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I giggled. “You must have looked rather like Bangs
himself!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s just the dickens of it—I did! Too much so—enough
at least to fool the police!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t mean they took you for that villain—not
actually?” cried Hattie May incredulously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They sure did!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But what did they want him for?” I asked. “Was it
the hair tonic?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, no, nothing like that. It seems he picked up a
car somewhere in Millport Saturday afternoon, drove
it out here last night and hid it in the woods up the
road. Then he came here to the house to pass the night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mean he stole a car—Oh, Michael, how terrible!”
cried Eve.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, it was bad luck for me, at any rate!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But surely you can prove that you didn’t take it,” I
put in. “Surely it will be easy enough to clear yourself!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I haven’t convinced ’em yet,” returned Michael
sombrely. “You see it was this way. Seems somebody
saw Bangs take the car around five o’clock that afternoon
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>and turned in a report to the police. Said the
thief had thick bushy hair and wore horn-rimmed
glasses. The cops traced the car out this way somehow—they
didn’t inform me how—and found it hidden in the
woods. Then they came on to the house, broke in, and
found me hiding in the hall closet, wearing a wig and
spectacles. That’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But didn’t you tell them?” I protested.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, naturally! But it didn’t get me anywhere. They
just laughed at me. Wanted to know what I was doing
in the house and so forth. I told them about Bangs and
that he was in the house too because I’d heard him
come in just before. That was when I got into the
closet. They pretended to make a search of the house
but they didn’t find him. They didn’t expect to—they
thought I was spoofing them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yeah and where was he—that’s what I’d like to
know?” Hamish spoke for the first time since Michael
had begun his story.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I haven’t any idea—I suppose he was hiding somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hattie May gave a startled glance toward the open
kitchen door as if she half expected the form of Mr.
Bangs to emerge at any moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course he’s had plenty of time to make a getaway
now,” Michael went on. “He’s had all night.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>“But when they found you, did they—did you——?”
I began hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yeah they took me over to the Millport jail,” returned
Michael stoically. “I phoned Al, my cousin, and
he came over about midnight and got me out. But I’ve
got to go to court on Thursday when the case comes
up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To c-court?” Eve’s eyes were harrowed. “But can’t
anything be done—your folks at home——?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael shook his head, his lips were set. “I’m not
going to tell them,” he stated. “I’ll take what’s coming
to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But they can’t convict you of something you never
did,” I broke in. “Why, it’s all too absurd!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I don’t know. You see it’s going to be sort of
hard to explain what I was doing in an empty house in
the middle of the night. And if Bangs has left the
country——” he shrugged.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wouldn’t it do some good if we were all to go over
to Millport and tell the—the judge or whoever it is,
that you were with us Saturday afternoon on the
beach?” Eve asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael shook his head positively. “I wouldn’t have
you get mixed up in it for anything,” he said. “Besides
they would simply think you were my friends
trying to help me out of a tight hole. They’d only
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>have your word that I was with you, you see.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve digested this. It was rather a new idea, I suppose,
that her word might not be good for much in a court
of law.</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael got up. “Well I’ve got to be getting back to
work,” he said. “How do you feel, Hamish? All right?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m awful hungry!” said Hamish.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Poor Hamish!” Eve cried. “Here we’ve been sitting
talking while you were starving to death! And after
that awful night!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well it was kind of messy down there,” Hamish
said. “It was lucky the bally old well was half filled up
or I might have been a goner. You see I landed on a lot
of leaves and old junk that had been thrown down
there to get rid of it, I s’pose. So I just made myself as
comfortable as I could and waited for daylight. I figured
that somebody’d be along lookin’ for me soon as it got
light. But it was kind of tiresome waitin’.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tiresome! I think you had pretty good nerve!” I said.
We all got up. “Hope my car’s all right,” Hamish
said, “I guess I’ll get me one of those Turkish baths up
at the hotel after I’ve had dinner.”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>We</span> tried to sew carpet rags that afternoon but
it was rather a farce. So much had happened
that morning that it seemed impossible
to settle down to anything so prosaic. We kept
talking of Michael and his awful predicament, and
racking our brains to think of some way of helping
him. Eve was inclined to blame Hamish for his part in
the affair, for not coming forward when he saw Michael
being taken into custody and vouching for his identity.
But I pointed out that Hamish himself would have had
some explaining to do and would probably have only
made matters worse by trying to account for Michael’s
presence in the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>We had of course told Aunt Cal the whole story but,
though she had been rather decent about the dandelion
wine, she had not displayed very much sympathy either
for Michael or Hamish. Her attitude was that they had
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>got no more than they deserved for meddling in things
that didn’t concern them. I felt that Aunt Cal was being
rather unjust for after all Michael had only been seeking
to aid the cause of justice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Beyond the hedge I caught sight of Captain Trout’s
bald head gleaming in the sun. He waved a pruning
knife at us and I said, “Let’s go over and tell him about
Michael. Perhaps he’ll be able to think of something
to do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Captain greeted us cordially and invited us to
take seats on his back porch. “We thought you ought
to know,” Eve said, “about the trouble that Michael
is in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Michael in trouble?” The Captain’s astonishment
was evident. “Dear me! Bless my boots! The finest boy
in the world!”</p>

<p class='c010'>This was comforting to hear at least. The Captain
listened as we gave him an outline of the story. “Bless
my boots!” he exclaimed again when we had finished.
“Why those police are asses! What do they mean not
believing the boy’s story—don’t they know he’s a Gilpatrick?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They don’t seem to consider it important,” I said.
“And Michael declares he won’t go to his family for
help.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Captain nodded understandingly. “That’s like
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>him,” he said. “His mother would be upset and his
grandfather, too, I expect. A grandson of Jason Gilpatrick
accused of stealing—why it’s absurd!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Isn’t Michael’s father living?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>Captain Trout shook his head. “Killed in the war,”
he said shortly. He seemed to be thinking deeply.
“Well,” he said at last, “I’ll have to see what can be done—I’ll
have to tell those guardians of the law a thing or
two!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Well at least we had done what we could for Michael;
though, as we talked it over, we wondered if the Captain’s
sputtering protestations would really have any
effect in a court of law. What Michael needed was proof
and that, alas, he didn’t have.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last I flung down the blue calico strip I was sewing
to another of black and white check. “I hate the very
sight of these miserable rags!” I exclaimed. “Let’s go
somewhere and do something quick before I chuck
them all in the brook!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve laughed. “We might go down to the Inn and inquire
about Hamish,” she suggested. “After his frightful
experience he may be in a state of collapse.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We found Hattie May on the veranda at Wildwood
Lodge, waiting, she told us, for Hamish to come out of
the barber shop of the hotel next door. “I sent him to
get a shampoo,” she said, “his hair was such a mess.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>“How is he feeling?” I inquired. “Fully recovered, I
hope.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes, he’s all right—physically, that is!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I just mean that he’s still acting kind of preoccupied.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s the shock,” Eve said. “Really you can’t be surprised.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hattie May shook her head. “There’s something he
wants to do,” she said, “but he won’t tell me what it is.
But he’s determined to go back to that terrible place
again right away!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What! Go back to Craven House? Gracious, I should
think he’d never want to see the place again!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know. But he insists there’s something he’s got to
see about. He says he was so hungry this morning that
he couldn’t attend to it. That’s why I’m watching the
door of the hotel, to be sure he doesn’t get away again
without me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>We sat down to wait. And it was not long before we
saw the figure of Hamish emerge from the hotel. He
cast a furtive glance in the direction of the Lodge and
then, in response to his sister’s frantic summons, came
slowly down the steps toward us. “What kept you so
long?” Hattie May inquired sharply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I thought I’d have the whole works while I
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>was about it,” he said. “Turkish bath, shampoo, oil
treatment, face steamin’ and manicure!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Heavens, no wonder you look like a boiled rabbit!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish took out his watch. “Well, I got to be gettin’
along,” he said with an attempt at casualness. “So long,
I’ll be seein’ you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As her brother’s form disappeared around the corner
of the building, Hattie May got up. “Come on,” she
whispered, and tiptoed down the steps. In single file we
passed around the veranda and, keeping well under
cover of the various barns and garages in the rear, came
presently to the main road, just across which are the
row of tin garages in one of which Hamish kept his
car. He was just unlocking the door when he looked
around and saw us. “What’s the big idea?” he inquired
ungraciously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The idea,” answered his sister, “is that we’re going
along. You don’t think for a minute that I’m going to
let you go out to that place alone again?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish’s answer was unintelligible and he was still
muttering to himself as he got into his seat. However
he waited, though unwillingly, while the rest of us disposed
ourselves—his sister beside him, Eve and I in
the rumble. For my own part, I had little desire to take
part in the expedition. If Hamish hadn’t had enough of
Craven House, I had. Besides I wondered what Aunt
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>Cal was going to think of more “meddling” on our
part.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish maintained an injured silence during the
greater part of the drive. And to my inquiry as to
whether he had heard anything more from Michael, he
shook his head and replied shortly, “Been sleepin’.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The day was hot and as we left the freshness of the
sea behind, the heat increased by the minute. So we
came again within the shadow of the old house. The
sweetness of the honeysuckle was almost overpowering.
I felt a sudden aversion to the place. All its air of
romantic mystery had departed. I hated it because it
had given shelter to that villain and ensnared Michael
and yes, because it had brought disappointment and disillusion
to Aunt Cal. “I think I’ll just wait in the
car,” I said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Sandy, what for?” Eve cried. And Hattie May
added, “Haven’t got cold feet have you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>This of course was too absurd to answer. Nevertheless
it compelled me to get reluctantly out of the car and
follow the others over the wall. Hamish was in the lead
but with Hattie May panting closely at his heels. He
vouchsafed no explanation as to where he was headed
or what his purpose was. And for my own part I didn’t
care much. I was sick of the whole subject of buried
treasure and wished heartily at that moment that we
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>had never opened Mr. Bangs’ smelly old suitcase. It had
been just like Pandora’s box, I reflected bitterly, for
nothing but trouble had come out of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>But if it was treasure that Hamish was intent upon,
at least he was seeking it in a new spot. For he passed
rapidly through the garden and plunged into the underbrush
beyond. “Well,” I said determinedly, “I’m not
going to get myself all scratched and bitten up again.
I’ll wait here by the fountain and if any of you fall down
any wells, don’t expect me to do anything about it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right,” said Hattie May. “But I’ve got to keep
Hamish in sight.” And Eve added, “I guess I’d better
go along to look after Hattie May.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So they left me and I heard their voices die away in
the distance. I took out my handkerchief and mopped
my hot face. I wished that the fountain were playing so
that I could have stuck my head into its cooling spray.
By and by I heard the others returning. Hattie May’s
voice was high-pitched and excited but that was nothing
unusual.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish was in the lead, he was carrying something
under one arm. I looked at Eve and saw that she too was
excited. “Well I see you’re all here,” I remarked.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish walked to the bowl of the fountain and set
down the thing he was carrying. “What is it?” I asked.
And then, “Why, it’s a statue! Where did you get it?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>“Hamish’s found it!” Hattie May cried. “He’s found
the Circe!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Circe!” In truth I had almost forgotten about
the missing statue. “Why—where in the world——?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was at the bottom of that awful well!” Hattie May
cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I brought it up with me when they hauled me up
this morning,” Hamish explained, taking off his glasses
to wipe them. “I guess you were all too excited to notice
it. It was pretty heavy so I just dropped it in the grass
and left it. Bein’ without my spectacles, I couldn’t be
sure what it was. You see when Hattie May dropped
that bottle down it hit on a stone and broke to smithereens.
This was the stone, that’s how I happened to
find it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hattie May threw me a triumphant look. “Don’t you
think it’s the Circe, Sandy?” Eve asked. “You see the
arms are broken off but one of them is lifted just as if
it might have been holding a wand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was true. The little figure was smaller than the
other one in the garden and it was so blackened by age
that the features were hardly discernible. But there was
no doubt that it was a woman’s figure and that one arm
had been upraised. In spite of myself, I felt a queer
shivery thrill as I gazed at it. “But where did it come
from?” I demanded eagerly. “Where did it stand?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>“That,” said Eve, “is just what we’ve got to find out.
There simply must be a pedestal somewhere that we’ve
overlooked. It certainly was never set up down
by that old well, nobody would put a statue in a vacant
lot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And when we find where she stood,” put in Hamish,
“then we’ll know where to dig!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Almost with one accord we all got up again and set
out on another tour of the garden. We had already
raked it pretty thoroughly but this time we had something
definite to urge us on. We had discovered the
enchantress, there remained only to discover her resting
place.</p>

<p class='c010'>Back and forth we wandered, poking at every tangle
of bushes and clump of thick grass, kicking at every
fallen tree branch. In his zeal, Hamish even began turning
up the slabs of stone which had once formed a walk
as if he expected to find some clue tucked away with
the horrid white crawly things underneath.</p>

<p class='c010'>Discouraged at last, I came back to the fountain.
After all, I told myself, I didn’t really believe in the
buried treasure. Michael didn’t, I knew, and I was
pretty sure he was right. Still I did wish we could find
where the statue had stood just—well just for the satisfaction
of knowing. But though Hamish and the others
were still plunging madly about, the search seemed as
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>hopeless as it had from the first. Indeed the discovery
of the statue had really helped matters little.</p>

<p class='c010'>Where would one put a Circe, I wondered? A small,
graceful figure like that? On a pedestal of course—but
where? Somewhere where she would not be overlooked,
I thought—some conspicuous place——</p>

<p class='c010'>And then, in a flash of inspiration, my eyes turned to
the center of the fountain. In imagination I saw her
there—lithe, poised, with arm upraised! And from that
vanished wand, I was suddenly sure, had come the jets
of water which had played in the sunshine of those
bygone summers!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eve! Hamish!” I cried excitedly. Picking up the
statue, I stepped across the leaf-filled bowl. I reached
up and set it there in the middle. “Look!” I shouted,
“It fits—fits perfectly!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It sure does!” I swung around to see Michael Gilpatrick
advancing toward me. In our absorption none of
us had heard the approach of his wagon. In a minute
the others came running at the sound of my excited
summons.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Sandy,” Eve cried, “how clever of you! How did
you happen to think of it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My aunt!” There was a grudging admiration in
Hamish’s voice as he gazed at the upright figure. “It
sure looks as if that was the place all right. I was just
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>thinkin’ of having a look at the fountain myself——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve gave him a scathing glance. “But look here!”
cried Hattie May. “If that’s the right place where are
we going to dig? We can’t dig up the fountain!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We won’t have to, silly,” said her brother. “It’s
thirteen and a half feet south of it that we’ve got to
measure.” He pulled a tape line from his pocket as he
spoke. “There’s a shovel hidden under that lilac bush
by the road,” he said to Michael. “I brought it with me
last night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Preparedness is your motto!” laughed Michael. For
the moment he seemed to have forgotten or thrown
aside the trouble that was hanging over him.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the time he had brought the shovel, Hamish had
located the spot to his satisfaction. It turned out to be
directly under a pink rosebush whose bushes hung
thickly to the ground. But Hamish was not to be
daunted by a few thorns.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder how deep down it’ll be!” breathed Hattie
May as Hamish’s shovel began to scratch at the hard
turf. “I’m glad you came along, Michael, in case it’s
very deep.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Michael doesn’t believe there’s anything there,” I
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not any buried treasure? Well, I’d like to know
what all those measurements mean then and why?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>Michael didn’t answer. There was a whimsical smile
on his tanned face as he stood watching Hamish
clumsily manipulating the heavy shovel. After a few
shovelsful of dirt had been piled in a heap on the grass
with little to show for the effort except the steadily
mounting color of Hamish’s face and the steam on his
glasses, Michael offered, “Like me to take a hand?”</p>

<p class='c010'>And still with that whimsical smile Michael set to
work. And now the earth began to fly to some effect
and the hole, which before had seemed to fill up almost
as fast as the earth came out, now began to grow quite
sizable. Hattie May stood at the very edge and watched
each shovelful as it came out. I thought, “She’s going
to be awfully let down if we don’t find anything.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Five minutes went by—ten. Michael was breathing
hard now, perspiration streaming down his face. “Better
let me take it now,” Hamish said but the other
shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>Deeper and deeper. Finally Michael stopped to wipe
his face. “If I was going to bury a blue emerald,” he remarked
with a grin, “or even a green one, I wouldn’t
bother to go much deeper than that!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish knelt down and thrust one of his lately manicured
hands deep into the hole. “Feel anything?” his
sister asked hopefully.</p>

<p class='c010'>He shook his head. “It’s a washout,” he said disgustedly.
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>“I don’t believe there ever was any bally old
treasure!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure you got the measurements right?” Michael inquired
with faint irony. The difference between his
attitude and Hamish’s was that Hamish was in deadly
earnest, while with Michael it was almost as if he was
playing a game.</p>

<p class='c010'>So perhaps it was only fair that it should be Hamish
who was wielding the shovel when it finally did strike
something. We all heard the impact. Hattie May
screamed and began to jump up and down. Hamish
dropped the shovel and dived, almost literally head
first into the hole. “There goes his shampoo, too!” I
thought.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There—there’s something!” he gasped. “Some—something
hard——!”</p>

<p class='c010'>I giggled, I couldn’t help it. It was partly nervous
excitement and partly the sense which had been with
me all along of the ridiculousness of the whole proceeding.
“That,” I said, “will be the iron bound chest
full of doubloons and pieces of eight, no doubt!”</p>

<p class='c010'>No one paid any attention to me. Hamish was groping
desperately with his fingers. “I c-can’t—seem—to—get
hold——!” he panted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let me have a try?” Michael put in quietly. Reluctantly
Hamish moved a little and, kneeling down in
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>his turn, Michael thrust one bare brown arm into the
hole. A minute later he was holding up a small, dirt-encased
object. As he shook off the clinging earth, we
saw an oblong tin box like a tobacco tin. I stared dazedly
at it—“Royal Plug” I read.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish seized the box from Michael’s hand. He
shook it. It rattled! Hattie May screamed again. “It’s
the emerald—the blue emerald!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish was prying at the lid with fumbling awkward
fingers. His sister snatched at it impatiently. “It
would take you a week to get that cover off!” she
cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the cover stuck obstinately. Michael took out his
jackknife. “Perhaps this will do it,” he offered.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>Hamish</span> took off his spectacles and wiped them
carefully as if he hoped by so doing to see
something different from the object which
was lying in Michael’s open palm. The object at which
the rest of us were also incredulously staring. It was
just a key—a long old-fashioned rusty key!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is—is that all?” Hattie May’s voice at last broke the
silence; it seemed to come from the region of her shoes.
For answer Michael took up the tobacco tin and turned
it upside down. “B-but there must be something else,”
she faltered. “Something else buried—the treasure—the
blue emerald!”</p>

<p class='c010'>With a shrug Michael again picked up the shovel
and set to work anew on the hole. But though he dug
steadily for as much as five minutes, he turned up nothing
more.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s just a washout like I said!” Hamish stated
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>gloomily. He glared at Eve and me, he seemed to hold
us responsible.</p>

<p class='c010'>I had picked up the key and was examining it. “I
suppose,” I said, “it’s the key to something.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s right,” chimed in Hattie May with a fresh
accession of hope. “Nobody would take the trouble to
bury a key unless it was to something pretty important.
Maybe to the box that holds the treasure or—or to a
locked room—or something. I’ll bet that’s it—the treasure’s
hidden in the house!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think there are any locked rooms in the
house,” remarked Eve. “Sandy and I went over it pretty
thoroughly that first day and we didn’t find any.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But there must be something!” Hattie May turned
and strode toward the back door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well I’ve got to be getting on,” Michael said. “I wish
you luck with your blue emerald!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Michael Gilpatrick,” Hattie May turned about and
faced him, “I don’t believe you’d take the trouble to
pick up that treasure if it was right before your eyes!
All you care about is cows and—and crops and plowing
and grubby things like that!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael’s ringing laugh answered her as he strode
away. “You can’t really blame him,” said Eve, “for not
being so awfully keen about this when he’s got that
other thing hanging over him! I’d be worried too.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>Hattie May and Hamish had disappeared inside the
house but they were back in five minutes. “Every door
in the place is wide open,” Hattie May declared in disgust,
“and the key doesn’t fit a single lock.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well I think the best thing for us to do now is to
go home,” I said. Somewhat to my surprise Hamish
agreed with my suggestion at once. I had not expected
him to give up the search so easily.</p>

<p class='c010'>Our own orderly garden was cool and refreshing that
night after the sticky heat of the day. We joined Aunt
Cal and Adam there after we had finished the dishes.
Under cover of the darkness I took my courage in my
hands. “Aunt Cal,” I asked, “did you ever hear that Captain
Judd Craven had—well anything valuable hidden
away? Any—well any treasure or anything?”</p>

<p class='c010'>At the word “treasure” I could fairly feel Aunt Cal
beside me stiffen. “Treasure!” she ejaculated scornfully.
“What has put such an idea into your head?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well that paper we found, in the first place,” I returned,
“the one with the measurements on it, you
know. And then this afternoon we dug up an old key
out there in the garden at Craven House. It was in a
tobacco tin just as if someone had hidden it on purpose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Cal made a noise that sounded like “pish!” “So
that’s what you’ve been up to,” she said caustically. “I
must confess that I’m considerably surprised that girls
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>of your age and upbringing should find nothing better
to do with your time! Buried treasure indeed!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you see, Aunt Cal,” Eve came to my defense, “it
did seem as if those directions must mean something,
especially after that fellow, that Mr. Bangs, wanted
them so badly that he came to the house here to look
for them. So then this morning when Hamish found
the missing statue of Circe down that old well and this
afternoon when Sandy discovered where she used to
stand, why we just had to find out what there was to
it, don’t you see? And then when we dug up the key,
why we just naturally couldn’t help wondering what it
was the key of.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Cal shook her head sadly. “I knew a man who
wasted the best years of his life in the search for treasure!”
she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mean Captain Craven’s son?” I asked timidly,
my heart beginning to beat a little faster for I felt that
I was on delicate ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>She nodded solemnly. “Carter Craven went to the
South Seas on a hunt for buried gold when he was
eighteen. It wrecked his life and broke his father’s
heart!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh!” I had never heard Aunt Cal speak like that
before!</p>

<p class='c010'>“He—he didn’t find anything?” Eve asked slowly.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>I could feel the flash in Aunt Cal’s eyes though I
could not see it. “Of course he didn’t. He was the victim
of a pack of adventurers! He was gone six years. And
when he came back,” her voice broke, “he was like an
old man! So—so changed!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Aunt Cal, how terrible!” I cried. “What did it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“His health was ruined for one thing—the life he’d
led, the climate, the companionships. And what was
worse, his moral fibre was gone! He had no desire to
work, to settle down to earn an honest living. His head
was full of schemes, get-rich-quick schemes. He drifted
from one to another. Nothing that he undertook ever
amounted to anything.” She broke off suddenly and
her voice softened ever so little. “I am telling you all
this,” she added, “so that you may understand what
the lure of gold can do to a human being.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We were silent for a long time after she had finished
speaking. If the truth be told I was feeling rather small.
Also I was experiencing a new understanding of Aunt
Cal. For the first time I had had a glimpse of the real
person behind the mask of severity she habitually wore.
It was Eve who finally ventured to put one more question.
“And Carter Craven,” she asked, “when he went
away the last time, was it for something like that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe so,” Aunt Cal returned shortly. “I was told
it was a gold mine, though I was not here at the time.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>“And no one has heard of him since?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She nodded. “I went into Millport yesterday to see
the lawyer who has charge of the estate, to tell him
about this man Bangs. I feel that if we could get hold
of him, he might be able to tell us something. But now
that he is wanted by the police, no doubt he will have
left the neighborhood for good.” She sighed.</p>

<p class='c010'>I sighed too. “I do wish they could find him before
Wednesday,” I said. “Then perhaps the police would
believe Michael’s story. If they don’t——” I broke off,
conscious that Aunt Cal was not listening. She seemed
utterly absorbed in her own thoughts.</p>

<p class='c010'>Didn’t she care, I thought, that the good name of a
perfectly innocent boy was about to be dragged in the
dust! As the minutes went by and still she said nothing,
all my newly aroused sympathy vanished. If she was so
indifferent to the troubles of others, she didn’t deserve
anybody’s sympathy. I grew so indignant, sitting there
in the darkness, that I finally could stand it no longer
and said I guessed I’d go to bed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“All she cares about,” I sputtered five minutes, later
as I pulled off my shoes and flung them into the corner,
“is that stuffy old house with its messy old garden and
its defunct fountain and—and all of its moldly old
memories!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re wrong, Sandy,” Eve said. “I think the thing
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>she cares most about is Carter—his memory, I mean.
I don’t think she’ll ever be happy till that is cleared.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I stopped with one stocking half off and looked at
Eve. “What in the world makes you think that?” I
inquired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you remember what Captain Trout hinted to
us, that some people thought Carter had destroyed his
father’s will?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh,” I said, light beginning to dawn, “you think
that is what’s eating Aunt Cal?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m sure of it. It isn’t the house, it’s the thought that
he would do such a thing—don’t you see?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But didn’t she say he was just a rotter anyway?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, but that was after he’d been away. Before perhaps
he was different. Perhaps she cared about him,
Sandy. I don’t mean in a sentimental way necessarily.
But maybe she was fond of him—they were cousins, you
know. Perhaps they played together when they were
children, went to school together——And it’s worse
to have people you’re fond of, people you’ve trusted, let
you down than anything, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I see,” I said. I regarded Eve thoughtfully. It
was not the first time that she had astonished me by
reading the motives and desires that were shut up inside
of people. Indeed as I thought about it, I found
this new view of Aunt Cal so interesting that Michael
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>and his troubles were, I’m ashamed to say, entirely forgotten
for the time being.</p>

<p class='c010'>As I lay and watched the sea breeze flutter the muslin
curtain, my imagination was busy with the girl who
had been Aunt Cal and the boy who had been Carter
Craven. I played with the idea that there had been a
romance between them. As for my uncle, Tom Poole,
well I just left him out of the picture.</p>

<p class='c010'>The morning, however, brought me back to reality.
It was Tuesday. Tomorrow Michael would have to go
to court. And nothing at all was being done about it!</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I could just be there,” Eve said soberly, “I’m sure
I could make that old judge listen to reason!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Aunt Cal,” I said, “would pass on at the suggestion—a
niece of hers in a police court!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose so!” Eve sighed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The morning’s mail brought an envelope addressed
to me. It was from Millport, from the photographer
where Hamish had taken my film to be developed. I
called to Aunt Cal to come and look as I spread out
the prints on the kitchen table.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look here we are in our bathing suits!” I said teasingly.
For dear Aunt Cal went bathing in the days when
girls wore ample costumes with full skirts trimmed with
white braid and little puff sleeves and collars buttoned
around their precious throats. We had come upon the
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>picture of her in one in an old album, so I knew.</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Cal took up the picture and scanned it stoically.
But instead of the comment of disapproval I had expected,
she only said, “I see you got the sail boats in
too.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, aren’t they pretty?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She nodded. Then she said a funny thing. “Your
young farmer friend shows up pretty good.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Michael, yes that’s him on the end.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Um. Didn’t you say it was Saturday that this car
he’s in trouble about was stolen?” she continued still
more unexpectedly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” I said, “Saturday afternoon about half past
five. Why do you ask, Aunt Cal?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She turned back to the sink where she was cleaning
beets for dinner. “Well,” she said, “you’ve got this picture,
haven’t you, with this boy in it? And you took
it Saturday afternoon. If he wants—what is it they
call it?—an alibi——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes of course,” I agreed. “But we can’t prove that
it was taken Saturday afternoon, don’t you see?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I say, but we can!” Eve fairly bounced out of
her chair. “Oh, Sandy, don’t you see?”</p>

<p class='c010'>I shook my head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why the yachts! They came in Saturday afternoon,
anybody in Fishers Haven would swear to that! And
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>Michael said, don’t you remember, that they only came
into this harbor once a year!”</p>

<p class='c010'>I gazed at Eve and then at Aunt Cal. And the mounting
excitement I felt was not only at the discovery that
perhaps we had found a way to save Michael but also
at the fact that it was Aunt Cal who had pointed it
out to us!</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>“Oh</span>, Sandy, what luck that you took that picture!”
Eve cried. “Shall we take it to Michael right
away or shall we wait till tomorrow and present
it as evidence when the case comes up in court?”
She looked doubtfully at Aunt Cal.</p>

<p class='c010'>As I had expected Aunt Cal said she couldn’t have us
poking around a police court and it was finally decided
that we should all take the noon bus to Millport and
see the lawyer whom Aunt Cal had visited on Saturday.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gracious, I haven’t been so excited in my whole life
before!” Eve said. “Oh, Sandy, if we can only save
Michael, won’t it be wonderful! I can’t decide what
dress I’d better put on—what do you think?” She stood
contemplating the row in her closet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I don’t think it’ll matter a whole lot,” I returned,
“as long as it’s clean and whole.” I had seldom
seen Eve so excited as she was that morning.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>“Oh, but we want to make a good impression, you
never can tell when a little thing like clothes will turn
the balance!”</p>

<p class='c010'>At last we were ready; Aunt Cal in her second best
silk, Eve and I in something far less impressive, but
feeling frightfully important just the same. We gulped
down a glassful of milk each before we started, too excited
to eat anything. Aunt Cal locked Adam in the
kitchen, more from long habit, I think, than because
she any longer feared he would be enticed away.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ride to Millport seemed interminable. It was a
quarter to two when we rolled into the dusty, car-lined
main street of the town.</p>

<p class='c010'>But luck was with us. Mr. Templeton, the lawyer,
was in, a portly man in shiny black who greeted Aunt
Cal cordially and motioned us to chairs. Aunt Cal inquired
whether there was any news of the man Bangs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing yet I’m afraid,” the lawyer said. “But we
may get hold of the fellow yet.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The girls have another matter they wish to discuss
with you if you can spare them a moment,” Aunt Cal
then said in her precise manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Spare the time!” I thought. “He’d jolly well better!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly,” Mr. Templeton beamed kindly upon us.
“Anything I can do——”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was Eve who told the story, of course. I would
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>surely have made a botch of it. When she had finished
she took out the photograph and laid it on the desk.</p>

<p class='c010'>He examined it, nodding once or twice, while I fumed
and twisted inwardly. “Well,” he said at last, “I think
perhaps the best thing we can do is to go over and have
a talk with the officer who has charge of the case. Perhaps
the young ladies will accompany me?” He looked
inquiringly at Aunt Cal.</p>

<p class='c010'>She nodded her assent. “I will wait here,” she said.
“The girls can go.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What about young Gilpatrick?” the lawyer inquired
as we set forth. “Any way of getting hold of him if we
should want him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Michael would be at the farm where he works
until five o’clock,” Eve told him. “It’s at Old Beecham,
Seaman is the name, I think.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The rest of the events of that perfectly thrilling afternoon
will always be slightly confused in my memory.
What actually did happen is so mixed with my doubts
and fears of what might. Would the august authority
which was the Law stoop to consider our plea at all and,
if it did, would it admit anything so trifling as a snapshot
taken by myself as evidence?</p>

<p class='c010'>I shall never forget the moment when the red-faced
policeman bent scowling over the picture; then handed
it to one of his colleagues to examine. Nor the moment
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>when Mr. Templeton, tiptoeing in in order not to
interrupt the conference that was going on, whispered
that he’d got hold of Michael by telephone and that
he’d be here in a short while.</p>

<p class='c010'>Most of all I shall never forget the moment when
Michael himself entered the room. He was breathing
fast after his hurried bicycle ride. He did not know what
he was wanted for of course but his mouth had that
same set look it had had when he had told us he’d
never go to his family for help. When he caught sight
of Eve and me, his astonishment for a moment wiped
out every other expression. But in answer to Eve’s encouraging
smile, he gave only a curt nod and turned
toward the desk. “You sent for me, sir?” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yeah,” drawled the officer. “Wanted to have another
talk with you ’bout what you did last Saturday
afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael’s lips closed harder; he didn’t answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let’s see, you told us yesterday, that you didn’t
come to Millport that day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where were you, then, Saturday afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael scowled. “Just where I told you—on Fishers
Haven Beach.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How long did you stay there?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“From a little bit after four till just about seven.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>“Are you in this picture?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael started as the policeman tossed the print
across the desk. He picked it up and looked at it. “Yes,”
he said, “there on the end.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When was this picture taken?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael stared for a second; then in a flash he got it!
“Why you can see for yourself,” he said, a new note in
his voice. “It was taken the day these yachts came in—last
Saturday afternoon. They come into the harbor the
second Saturday in July every year. Here, you can see
where the last of them is just coming inside the breakwater!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The other nodded. But the man beside the desk spoke
suddenly: “How do we know this here picture wasn’t
taken Sunday morning when the boats went out?” he
inquired.</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael laughed at him; it was his old light-hearted,
ringing laugh. “Well, you ought to know, sir,” he
said, “that you can’t face inland and have the sun in
your face on Fishers Haven Beach in the morning! The
yachts leave early; the sun would have been behind us
instead of in our faces. Besides the position of the sails
in the picture shows which way the boats were moving.
If they’d been going out——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right,” the officer interrupted. “That’s all.
Charge dismissed.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>“Oh,” Eve cried, “and he won’t have to go to court
tomorrow!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s right,” the officer said with something that
approached a smile. He turned to Mr. Templeton and
the two conferred together. I caught the name of Bangs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael came toward us; he was actually embarrassed.
But the familiar quirky smile played about his
lately solemn countenance. He had come from the
farm just as he was and didn’t even wear a coat over
his turned-in blue shirt. “I thought I told you,” he
said with the pretense of a scowl, “that I didn’t want
you mixed up in this!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you angry with us?” Eve asked demurely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Furious! And besides, I never am any good at saying
thank you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then don’t,” retorted Eve. “Anyway it was all Aunt
Cal’s doing. She was the one who first saw what the
picture might do for you.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>“I think</span> it was just poisonous of you not to let us
know!” Hattie May pouted. “I’d just have adored
going to a police station!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But there wasn’t time, Hattie May,” I protested.
“We just had to rush off to catch the bus as soon as we
thought of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s just an excuse,” she declared. “You could have
phoned me and I’d have come right away. I’ll bet I
could have managed those policemen!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But they didn’t need any managing! All we had to
do was to show ’em the picture.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish, who had been lounging on the porch rail,
gazing gloomily into space, sighed heavily. “Well,” he
said, “I guess me and Hattie May might as well go
back home. We don’t seem to be much use round
here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nonsense, Hamish,” I said. “You ought to be rejoicing
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>that Michael doesn’t have to go to court, instead
of grousing around.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course I’m glad he got off,” Hamish returned
with dignity. “But, considerin’ everything, I don’t think
you ought to have taken an important step like that
without consulting me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>I began to feel annoyed. “Well,” I sputtered, “you
weren’t so awfully anxious to help Michael the night
he was arrested. Why didn’t you talk then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish looked more grieved than he had before.
“Girls don’t understand ’bout such things,” he said. “If
I’d popped out of those bushes when they were taking
Michael away, they’d simply have taken me along too
and asked questions later!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, don’t let’s argue,” Eve said soothingly.
“Michael’s free—that’s the main thing!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish did not answer. He drew a small square package
from his pocket and eyed it sardonically. “Just
money thrown away!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s that?” Eve asked dimpling. “A present for
me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No it isn’t. It’s a little contraption I picked up for
Michael—thought it would help him while away the
long hours of his—er—incarceration!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hamish Lewis,” I cried, “how can you talk in that
cold-blooded, outrageous, unfeeling, mean manner?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>“Well you don’t need to get excited, he isn’t going,
is he? But the way things were day before yesterday,
it certainly looked as if he was.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it?” Eve broke in. “Do show me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish opened the package and shook out onto his
palm several small brass rings looped together. “It’s a
puzzle,” he explained. “The thing is to get all the rings
onto this big one.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very appropriate for a man in jail!” Hattie May
giggled.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish glared at her and returned the puzzle to its
box. “No one,” he said, “ever appreciates anything I try
to do!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, come, Hamish, do cheer up,” Eve urged. “I’m
sure there are loads of people who would just eat that
puzzle up, so to speak. Folks with spare time on their
hands like—” her glance strayed to the house beyond
the hedge—“like Captain Trout for instance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish brightened visibly. “Do you really think he’d
like it?” he said. “But I scarcely know the old bird!
Wouldn’t he think it kind of funny if I went over and
just said, ‘By the way here’s a present for you’?”</p>

<p class='c010'>We all laughed. “What about the hair tonic?” I asked.
“You were going to give him that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish scowled. “That was different,” he said
shortly, “entirely a different matter!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>“I tell you,” Eve said jumping up. “Let’s all go over
and make him a call. We ought to tell him about
Michael’s case being dismissed; perhaps he hasn’t heard.
Then Hamish can show him the puzzle and if he warms
to it——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hattie May was still pouting as we made our way
around by the front gate to the Captain’s back door. To
my surprise the door was closed, though the cloud of
smoke which was issuing from the chimney seemed to
indicate that the Captain was at home and doing some
cooking.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish was just about to knock when Eve caught
his arm. “Listen!” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c010'>From behind the door came the sound of voices. One
of them, slightly nasal, I recognized as the Captain’s.
The other was low-pitched and gruff. “He’s got company,”
I whispered. “Maybe we’d better not bother him
just now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish looked disappointed. And we were still hesitating
when the door was flung violently open and the
Captain himself burst out. “Hot as blazes in there, Biscuits!”
he sputtered. “Need some air——” He stopped
short as he became aware of our presence. “Well, well,
well, bless my boots!” With that he turned and closed
the door behind him with a slam and advanced to the
middle of the porch, where he stood gazing at the street.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>But the door had not closed before I had had a fleeting
glimpse of a figure bent over the stove—a short
thickset figure in a sailor’s trousers and a sleeveless
shirt.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Something smells awfully good,” Eve said by way
of relieving the embarrassment which seemed to have
seized us all. “We came over to tell you about Michael,”
she added. “His case has been dismissed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t say—well, that’s fine!” The Captain motioned
us to seats and began fumbling for his pipe.
“Glad you dropped in; tell me all about it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>While we told the story for the second time that
morning, I was conscious that the Captain’s eyes strayed
every now and then toward the closed door as if he
were fearful that it might open. All the time we talked
the clatter of pans and the sound of sizzling fat reached
us and once I distinctly heard a raucous cough.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was after a particularly loud crash as if some large
tin receptacle had fallen to the floor that the Captain
remarked with a nervous chuckle, “Got me a new cook.
He thinks he’s in a ship’s galley, I guess! Ha, ha!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It must be awfully hot cooking on a day like this,”
Hattie May remarked guilelessly. “I should think he’d
want the door open.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Captain shook his head positively. “Not a bit of
it. He likes it hot—used to it. Tropics, you know;
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>the hotter, the better! Why, would you believe it, I
actually had to go up attic last night and bring him down
a winter blanket? Said he had a chill!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Really!” exclaimed Hattie May. “The poor fellow!”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was at this moment that the Captain’s fear was
realized. The door did open but it was only a crack, just
enough to let out a strong odor of frying grease borne
on a cloud of smoke and, with it, the form of Daisy
June, her tail erect and her fur on end.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Jumpin’ Jericho!” exploded the Captain jumping to
his feet. But before he could reach the door, it had
slammed again, while the kitten streaked across the grass
and disappeared under a bush.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m afraid we’re keeping you from your dinner,”
Eve said, rising.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not a bit of it,” the Captain assured her. But as if
to give denial to his assertion, at that moment a ship’s
gong was heard booming loudly from within. Mechanically
we all got to our feet. “Aunt Cal’s awfully
annoyed with us when we don’t come to dinner on
time,” Eve went on conversationally. “I really think
you ought to go in, Captain.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, well, that’s too bad!” The Captain’s polite protestations
followed us as we descended the steps and
marched, in single file, to the front gate. No one spoke
till we had reached Aunt Cal’s side porch. We seated
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>ourselves in a row on the top step. It was Hattie May
who broke the silence. “Another mystery!” she exclaimed.
“I guess Hamish and I’ll stay the week out
anyway.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fat chance,” said Hamish, “of finding out anything
with that door kept shut! And the Captain guarding it
like a bally old sea dog or sumpin.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I dare say,” I said lightly, “that there’s really no
mystery at all. Perhaps the Captain simply considered
that the seafaring gentleman from the tropics wasn’t
fit company for what he calls ‘young ladies’.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hattie May shook her head emphatically. “Nonsense!
He was jumpy as a rabbit! There’s more to it
than that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It did all seem a little—queer,” Eve mused. “What
do you think, Hamish?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish looked appeased at this deference to his opinion.
“Well if you want to know what I think,” he stated
significantly, “I think he’s hiding someone!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you mean—Bangs?” I breathed. And we all
stared at Hamish’s round solemn face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s what he calls himself!” he answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hamish, for Pete’s sake, what are you driving at?”
his sister burst out. “If you’ve got anything to tell why
on earth don’t you tell it? You’re not in the secret service
yet, you know! Stop acting like a ‘G’ man.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>“Oh, all right, all right—make fun of me! Treat me
’sif I was Buddie, the Boy Detective, if you want to!”
He got up stiffly and started down the path toward his
car.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hamish,” called Eve softly, “please don’t go yet.
What are we going to do about this—this criminal next
door? I’m scared stiff!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He turned about and regarded her suspiciously. But
the sincerity in her brown eyes apparently reassured
him. “Well,” he said, coming back and reseating himself,
“if you want my advice—I think the place oughta
be watched.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If the man the Captain’s hiding really is Bangs,”
Eve said thoughtfully, “then I think we ought to tell
Aunt Cal. She’s very anxious to have a talk with him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, no, you mustn’t do that—not yet!” Hamish returned
quickly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But why not?” I protested.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, gosh, don’t you see!” Hamish’s impatience with
the female intellect was apparent. “Don’t you see that
Bangs—or whatever his name is—is the only person
who can lead us to that treasure—or whatever he’s after
at Craven House? If he’s arrested, the game’s up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hamish is perfectly right,” agreed Hattie May in
mounting excitement. “What we’ve got to do is to
watch!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>“But why should the Captain be hiding the man if it
is Bangs?” I demanded. “It makes him guilty too in a
way—what is it they call it—an accessory!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You can depend upon it,” returned Hamish profoundly,
“he has his reasons.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Cal opened the door. “Dinner’s ready,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hattie May and Hamish got up. “Keep your eye on
the place as much as you can,” Hamish said in a whisper.
“I’ll be round as soon as it gets dark.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mean you’re going to watch the house all
night?” Eve asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure. But don’t say anything to your aunt yet. Not
until tomorrow anyway. Promise?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We-ll, all right,” Eve agreed reluctantly. “We
promise.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch22' class='c014'>XXII<br /> <br />The Escape</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>I had</span> looked forward to a swim that afternoon but
Hamish’s request that we keep an eye on the house
next door forced us reluctantly to abandon the
plan. Hamish might be a bit theatrical at times but there
was no denying the fact that the Captain had a strange
visitor and that, for whatever reason, he had appeared
most unwilling to make us acquainted with the gentleman.
So there did seem some sense in the idea that we
keep our eyes peeled for what went on in our neighbor’s
domain.</p>

<p class='c010'>But as the long afternoon wore away, it seemed evident
that nothing at all was going on. The smoke had
long since died away from the chimney and, though
the back door still remained fast closed, there was no
sign of activity within.</p>

<p class='c010'>I had been, I will confess, a little surprised that Eve
had given Hamish her promise to say nothing to Aunt
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>Cal about the mysterious guest next door. For Eve,
though she could never be called in the least goody
goody, has nevertheless rather strict ideas about honor
and all that. She knew that the police were searching for
Bangs and yet she was keeping silent.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eve,” I said at last. She had given up the pretense of
sewing and was lying in the fragrant shadow of the
syringa bush, her eyes on the drifting foamy clouds.
“Eve, why did you agree not to tell Aunt Cal?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why,” she frowned a little, “I only agreed to keep
it dark till tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But why did you agree at all?” I insisted. “It wasn’t
because of that buried treasure stuff—because he might
lead us to that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, it wasn’t that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then what was it?” I demanded caught by something
evasive in her tone. “What was the reason?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, well, I suppose I might as well tell you! You
heard what Hamish said, didn’t you, about Bangs—that
his real name might be something else?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course, but what of it? Suppose his name is Jones
or Brown, what’s that got to do with it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hasn’t it ever occurred to you, Sandy,” she said
slowly, “that it’s rather strange that this man has the
key to Craven House and—well, that he knows his way
about inside it so well that he was able to hide from the
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>police the night they searched for him? Doesn’t that
strike you as rather peculiar?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eve, what are you driving at?” I cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, suppose—just suppose—that Bangs, instead of
being someone who could give Aunt Cal news of Carter
Craven, suppose he was—was Carter himself!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Carter Craven! Oh, Eve, it couldn’t be! Why, he’s
supposed to be dead, isn’t he? And—oh, besides—why
this man is just a little sawed-off, bald headed rascal!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, you’ve got to remember that Carter was nothing
more than a good-for-nothing—Aunt Cal practically
said so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He might be a good-for-nothing,” I retorted, “but
that doesn’t make him a common thief. Besides,” I
added firmly, “I don’t believe Aunt Cal could ever have
been fond of a man with bowlegs!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What have his legs got to do with it, I’d like to
know?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well you know what I mean—he just isn’t the type
to be Carter Craven!” And yet as I uttered the words a
horrible doubt had begun to assail me. Suppose Eve was
right, suppose this skulking vendor of fake hair lotions
should turn out to be the long missing son of Craven
House, well where did that put us? So far as we were
concerned, of course, it didn’t really matter except that
it made everything seem rather sordid. But Aunt Cal,
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>how would she feel to find her own cousin facing a
charge for petty thievery? Was that why Eve had promised
to keep still?</p>

<p class='c010'>“You want him to escape then?” I demanded. “On
account of Aunt Cal?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well wouldn’t it be the best thing that could happen?”
she returned. “It isn’t of course as if they hadn’t
recovered the car.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But the treasure—that letter—those measurements?
If he goes—we’ll never know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She shrugged. “What does that matter compared with
Aunt Cal’s pride? As things are she can think of Carter
as having died peacefully in some foreign country. Of
course there’s the little matter of the will—still nothing
ever has been proved. Whereas this crime of stealing—everyone
would know if Carter was charged with that!”</p>

<p class='c010'>I sighed. I felt terribly disillusioned. “I don’t believe
he is Carter!” I repeated stubbornly. “Carter was an adventurer—wild,
restless, perhaps—but big in his way
like the old Captain, his father.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In short a kind of romantic, story book hero!” retorted
Eve cruelly, “wavy raven locks and fiery piercing
eye and all that!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And straight legs!” I added. “Well, we’ll wait and
see!”</p>

<p class='c010'>After supper Miss Rose Blossom appeared to discuss
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>Civic Betterment plans with Aunt Cal and the two were
closeted in the front parlor for the rest of the evening.
Things could not have turned out better for us. Just
as dusk was beginning to fall we heard a low whistle
from the bushes by the front fence and going out, found
Hamish crouched behind them. “Where is she?” he
whispered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the parlor with the windows shut so you don’t
need to whisper,” I said. “And by the way, if it’s not
too much to ask, I’d like to know what you expect to
do in case this—this creature next door does try to
escape?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll follow him of course,” he said still speaking in
a guarded undertone as if he imagined there was some
hidden listener behind the next bush. “If he’s who I
think he won’t be leaving these parts till he’s got hold
of what he’s after!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mean you’d follow him if he went out to Craven
House tonight?” I demanded. “Does Hattie May
know?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never mind Hattie May,” he retorted shortly. “I’ve
got to see this thing through and I’m not going to have
any interference from girls, d’you hear?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve giggled. “Well do try to keep away from wells
and things, won’t you? And I do hope you won’t catch
your death of cold out here in the damp yard.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>“I’ve got my raincoat,” he said. “Now all you’ve got
to do is to scram—see—and keep your mouths shut!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Absolutely,” Eve said. “Good luck—see you in the
morning!”</p>

<p class='c010'>It did seem funny going to bed with Hamish hiding
out there in the bushes. Would he really stick it out, I
wondered? Sometimes there seemed more to Hamish
than appeared on the surface. Eve poked back the curtains
after she had blown out the light. “See anything
of him?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not even a shadow! Wonder what Aunt Cal would
think if she knew that the house was guarded!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Darkness and quiet descended then. Soon Eve’s even
breathing told me that she was asleep. For awhile I lay
wondering some more about Captain Trout’s visitor,
coming finally to the common-sense view that he was
just what the Captain himself had stated—a ship’s
cook, perhaps temporarily out of a job. Having reached
this conclusion, I fell comfortably asleep.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next thing I was conscious of was a footstep in
the hall outside the bedroom door. My first startled
thought was of the cook. Then I heard the steps descending
the stairs, soft but firm. Aunt Cal, of course.
But the dark square of the window told me that it
couldn’t be morning yet—why was she going downstairs
in the middle of the night? What prompted her?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>I was wide awake at once. What had happened? Had
I missed something? I slipped out of bed and to the
open bedroom door. The reflection of a light was on the
wall, coming from the hall below. I stole to the top of
the stairs. I could hear the key turning in the front
door—something very special must be up, I thought. I
couldn’t just stand there and listen, I’d got to know.</p>

<p class='c010'>I flew back to the bedroom, got into my dressing
gown and slippers. Eve had not stirred. A minute later
I was following Aunt Cal out onto the narrow front
stoop. She had set the lamp down on the little stand in
the hall and the light from it streamed out. She turned
and saw me as I started down the steps. “What is the
matter?” I whispered.</p>

<p class='c010'>Instead of the rebuke I had looked for, she said indignantly,
“There’s a tramp asleep behind the hedge!
I don’t know what this town is coming to!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“B-but how do you know?” I stammered. “I mean
maybe you just imagined it—the shadows, you know—and—and
all——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sandra, you’d better go back to bed,” she returned
severely. “I do not require any advice or assistance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, of course not,” I returned hastily. “I just meant
that things are deceptive at night. And even if it is a
tramp,” I went on desperately, “wouldn’t it be better
to wait till morning? At least it would be safer.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>She was not listening to me. She had now advanced
firmly halfway across the little front yard toward the
hedge. “Why on earth couldn’t Hamish have stayed out
of sight?” I thought, “and what had moved my aunt
to look out of the window in the middle of the night
anyway!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Cal reached the hedge and peered over it. “Come
out of there,” she ordered loudly, “or I shall have you
arrested for trespassing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no answer. She advanced along the hedge,
she was approaching the clump of bushes where we had
last seen Hamish. I held my breath. If only I could do
something to prevent the revelation that was impending!
I wished Eve were there, she might have had an
inspiration.</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Cal had reached the bushes. She had picked up
a stick and now began poking at them fiercely. “Come
out of there!” she repeated. “Or I shall call the police!”</p>

<p class='c010'>All of a sudden my eyes, which had been vainly trying
to pierce the shadows, were attracted upward. In
the house beyond the hedge a light had winked on. It
was in the little upper window facing our way. Aunt
Cal saw it too for she paused momentarily in her
poking.</p>

<p class='c010'>And while our attention was thus distracted, a figure
hurtled from between the bushes and the hedge and
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>plunged headlong through the latter and on across
Captain Trout’s back yard, a rubber coat flapping about
its ankles as it ran. “There! What’d I tell you!” Aunt
Cal exclaimed. “The miserable loafer!”</p>

<p class='c010'>We watched the figure disappear into the darkness.
“Tomorrow,” said my aunt, “I shall make a complaint.
Come, you must go back to bed at once, you’ll catch
your death on this wet grass.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Aunt Cal,” I said meekly, and followed her
back into the house. And without further ado I presently
found myself back in my own room again with
the door, by special admonition of Aunt Cal, locked
on the inside.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the light in Captain Trout’s upstairs window still
winked across the grass and now and then, I could see
it blink as if a figure stepped between it and the
window. Perhaps the cook had had another chill, I
thought with an inward chuckle, and had demanded
still more blankets! Well anyway Hamish had got
safely away. Then, suddenly as it had come, the light
winked out.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’re you looking at?” Eve stirred sleepily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing,” I began and stopped. Someone was coming
out of the house next door—a short figure in white
duck trousers, dark coat and visored cap. The Captain?
Where on earth could he be going at this ungodly hour?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>Eve was beside me, I could hear her catch her breath.
“It’s him!” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mean the Captain?” I asked, puzzled at her
intensity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course not. Can’t you see the way he walks and—and
his legs!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mean it’s the cook all togged up like that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Disguised of course. We might have expected something
like this. I suppose Hamish is asleep by now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” I said, “I don’t think so. The last I saw him
he was hoofing it across Captain Trout’s back yard in
the general direction of the sea.” And I told her what
had happened.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why on earth didn’t you wake me?” she said when
I had finished. “To think I should have missed it all! Do
you think Aunt Cal suspects anything?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think so. Where d’you suppose he’s going,
Eve—the cook, I mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Back to sea, very likely.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then that’ll be the end—of everything. And we’ll
never know who he was or what he wanted!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve yawned. “Well that’s apt to be the way things
peter out in real life, you know,” she said. “The villains
just walk out of the picture.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the noble man hunter takes to his heels!” I
sighed.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>Hattie May</span> came over early next morning. She
was in a frightful temper and declared she
was going to take the next train back to
Mason’s Cove and leave Hamish to his fate.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s he done now?” I inquired. “No more run-ins
with the police, I hope?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So far as I’m concerned,” she stated, “he could languish
in a foul dungeon before I would lift a finger to
extrapate him!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Extricate, I expect you mean,” I said. “But what has
he done?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She flung herself into Aunt Cal’s rocker on the back
porch and began to rock violently. “He locked me in
my room, that’s what he did!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Locked you in your room? But whatever for?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ll have to ask him that! It was last night. As
soon as I was convinced he actually meant to carry out
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>his crazy plan of watching that house, I told him he
shouldn’t go one step without me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, well? I suppose he didn’t take to the notion?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear, he just shut up like a clam. And all during
supper I couldn’t get a single solitary civil word out of
him. It made me awfully embarrassed, sitting at the
table with the other people all chatting away and him
acting like that! Never once opening his mouth except
to shovel in food.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Disgusting!” I agreed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well right after supper I went upstairs to get me a
heavy sweater because I knew if I’d got to sit up all
night out in your yard I’d need it. Well I was rummaging
in the closet when I heard the door close very
softly and locked from the outside! Can you imagine!
The ingrate had followed me upstairs, waited till my
back was turned and then turned the key.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But how did you get out?” I asked, stifling a desire
to giggle. “Did the ingrate return?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose he must have,” she answered indifferently.
“The door was unlocked this morning. He didn’t appear
at breakfast so I suppose he’s asleep.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know how you must feel, Hattie May,” said Eve
sympathetically. “But I suppose Hamish felt that what
he had to do was a man’s job——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Man’s job!” she interrupted, with a scornful snort.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>“Well he felt that girls around would sort of gum
things up. He sent us packing in pretty short order.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then he came?” she asked with curiosity. “Did anything
happen?”</p>

<p class='c010'>I told her about Aunt Cal’s interruption of the vigil
and then about the departure of the mysterious stranger
from the house next door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My goodness,” she exclaimed when I had finished.
“Then there is something to it. The man’s a crook or
he wouldn’t sneak off like that in the dead of night. I
certainly am glad Hamish wasn’t there to see him,
though. Why he might have been trailing the man yet,
he might even have followed him onto a ship and gone
to sea!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, you know persistence is a fine quality,” I remarked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes, it’s all very well for you to stand up for
him but you didn’t spend the night under lock and
key. I kept waking up and thinking what I would do
if there was a fire, and I thought how Hamish would
feel when he gazed at my charred body!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, well, there wasn’t any fire and you spent a comfortable
night in bed instead of on the damp ground,”
Eve said soothingly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hattie May seemed to be thinking. “I do think it’s
a crime that a man like that should be allowed to
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>escape,” she said at last. “I wonder if Hamish knows
about it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, since you’re not on speaking terms with him,”
I giggled, “I don’t see how you’re going to find out.
Besides if you’re leaving on the afternoon train——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I suppose I’d better stick around,” Hattie May
said. “We can’t be sure that the fellow has gone back
to sea and—there’s the key!”</p>

<p class='c010'>But for all Hattie May’s sticking around, no more was
seen of Captain Trout’s mysterious visitor. Aunt Cal reported
to the local constable that a tramp attempted to
pass the night in her yard and the following evening
we saw a uniformed figure peering over our hedge just
after dusk. But apparently discouraged by his failure to
round up anything more criminal than Daisy June chasing
fireflies, he soon abandoned the pursuit and retired—we
guessed—along with other respectable citizens
to the shelter of his own roof.</p>

<p class='c010'>So much for the tramp! As for Captain Trout—whom
Hattie May now dubbed our perfidious neighbor—nothing
much was to be got out of him. A guarded
reference on Eve’s part to his late guest elicited merely
the statement that he, the Captain, couldn’t stomach so
much fried food and had sent the fellow packing.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was one day after dinner, the following week, that
Aunt Cal, who had spent the morning baking, said she
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>had made a little spice cake for Mrs. Viner. “I was expecting
to take it out to her this afternoon,” she remarked,
“but Rose has called a meeting of the Civic
Betterment to see about those folks burning rubbish
in the lot beyond the millpond. Of course the cake will
keep——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, do let us take it out, Aunt Cal?” I begged.
“We’d just love to.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know about that,” she shook her head doubtfully.
“After what happened to my dandelion wine——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, please don’t hold that up against us,” Eve
pleaded. “You must admit the circumstances that time
were unusual. Hamish isn’t likely to fall into another
well—at least I hope not!”</p>

<p class='c010'>No one can resist Eve for long. And so in the end,
Aunt Cal packed the cake in a basket and entrusted it
to our keeping. “Tell Mrs. Viner I’ll be out to see her in
a few days,” she said. “That is, if you see her!” she added
dryly.</p>

<p class='c010'>I took the basket. “Aunt Cal,” I said, “this day will
vindicate our reputation, you can depend upon it!” I
blew a kiss toward her as I opened the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, if you take my advice,” she sent a parting shot
after us, “you won’t make any stops on the way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We decided to walk down the shore road and call
for Hattie May. She had been so disappointed at our
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>failure to take her to Millport on Michael’s affair that
we were anxious not to seem to slight her again. “But
I’m not at all sure she’ll be good for the invalid,” Eve
remarked. “She’s quite as likely as not to tell her she’s
looking poorly or start talking about some lovely funeral
she went to!”</p>

<p class='c010'>We found her alone. “I’ve just finished a letter to
Mother,” she said, “and I guess Hamish’ll be hearing
from Dad before long!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t mean he’s still acting strangely?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear, I scarcely see him at all except at meals
and he won’t tell me a solitary thing!”</p>

<p class='c010'>We caught the two o’clock bus from the square and
at a little before three were opening the gate of the
big stone house which Aunt Cal had described to us.
Somewhat to my relief, we found the invalid much improved
and sitting out in the sun. She welcomed us
cordially and I guessed that she was pleased enough
to have some one new to talk to. We chattered on, telling
her about school, about Hamish’s fall into the well
and about our discovery of the statue of Circe at the
bottom of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear me,” she exclaimed, “what a terrible experience
for the poor boy. I wonder that he retained his
reason, I’m sure I shouldn’t have!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m not a bit sure that he has,” Hattie May said
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>feelingly, “at least not all of it. The way he acts!”</p>

<p class='c010'>We laughed and Mrs. Viner said, “I remember so
well when the old Captain—as we used to call him—first
set up those statues in his garden. My, what a lot
of talk it made!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You knew Aunt Cal when she was a girl, I suppose?”
I said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, dear, yes, we went to school together. At the old
district school that was torn down when they put the
state road through.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you know my uncle, Tom Poole, too?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. Cal and Tom were married the year before the
old Captain died. When she came back from the West,
I hoped I would have her for a neighbor but—well,
things turned out differently,” she added discreetly.</p>

<p class='c010'>We talked on till suddenly Eve jumped up. “We
were cautioned the other time we started to call on
you not to stay more than ten minutes,” she said, “and
not to talk any nonsense. I’m afraid we’ve broken both
rules.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The idea!” Mrs. Viner laughed. “You mustn’t take
your Aunt too seriously.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But we really must go now,” I agreed. “You see our
reputation is at stake today. Aunt Cal doesn’t really
trust us out of her sight any more.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Cal’s bark is a lot worse than her bite,” Mrs. Viner
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>returned. “And you’re to tell her from me that I’m feeling
much better for your visit.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A short distance beyond Mrs. Viner’s gate, Eve
stopped suddenly. “If there was any other way to go
home,” she said, “I’d be in favor of taking it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well there isn’t,” I retorted. “And if you find that
old house so enticing that you can’t even walk by it, it’s
just too bad! For my part I wouldn’t care if I never
saw it again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just the same let’s—well, let’s rest a minute,” she
said. “Here on the wall.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Rest? Gracious we’ve just started!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve sat down. “I just happened to think,” she said
carelessly, “that it’s about time for Michael to come
along.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Huh!” I retorted. “I’ll bet you’ve been planning to
wait for him all the afternoon. I think you’re a shameless
hussy!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hattie May giggled. “I don’t see why we shouldn’t
wait for him,” she said. “If he has his wagon he’ll give
us a lift.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, and if he’s on his bicycle, he’ll wave his hand
and go sailing by. And we’ll miss the bus!”</p>

<p class='c010'>We were still arguing when the faint rattle of a
wagon fell on our ears and a moment later, Michael’s
blue shirt and brown head appeared above the brow
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>of the hill. “Hello,” he called as he drew alongside of
us, “waiting for some one?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just resting,” Eve told him with a twinkle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t want a lift then?” he grinned.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well perhaps we might—what d’you think, girls?”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Hattie May was already in the front seat and
Eve and I climbed into the rear as we had done that
first day when we had fairly to beg for a ride.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Anything new in the mystery line?” Michael inquired
with a slap of the reins.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well,” said Eve between jolts, “your friend Captain
Trout has been harboring a visitor—a kind of cooking
recluse, if you know what I mean. But he left in the
dead of night arrayed in white trousers and a visored
cap.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael did not seem greatly impressed by these
revelations. “The Captain knows a lot of seafaring
birds,” he said. “Very likely the fellow blew in between
sailings.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you don’t think it was Bangs?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How should I know. But there’s something else you
might be interested in—somebody’s been digging up
that old garden again.”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>At</span> these words my heart sank. “There goes all our
good resolutions and promises!” I thought. For
of course I knew that we’d never go straight
home now!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Digging up the garden!” cried Eve. “How d’you
know?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I saw it this morning when I stopped to have a look
for my flashlight which I mislaid the night I was—ah—pinched!
The door was locked, and I couldn’t get
into the house. On my way out I noticed that somebody’d
been at work in the garden in a new place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then that creature hasn’t left the country at all,”
Hattie May cried. “It’s just as I suspected, he’s still after
the treasure!”</p>

<p class='c010'>We were approaching the house. “Want to stop and
have a look?” Michael inquired teasingly. “Might pick
up a clue—collar button or whatnot! Don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>“Oh, no, I don’t think we’d better,” I began hurriedly,
though I knew as I said it that it was useless.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course we must stop,” Hattie May declared.
“Hamish would never forgive me if I neglected a single
clue!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We-ll,” said Eve doubtfully, “I don’t suppose it
would really do any harm just to run in for a minute.
So long as we don’t have to catch the bus,” she glanced
doubtfully at me.</p>

<p class='c010'>I shrugged. “Do just as you like,” I said, “but don’t
expect me to explain things to Aunt Cal!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Leave Aunt Cal to me!” Eve laughed lightly and
began to climb down from the wagon. Without enthusiasm
I followed her and once more found myself
making my way over the wall, across the yard toward
the tangled garden. It was getting to be a habit, I reflected.
It almost seemed as if some unknown force kept
drawing us back to the old house and its secrets.</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael pointed out the place where a new hole had
been dug nearby where we had discovered the first one,
and apparently hastily filled in again. Could it be that
Bangs had returned?</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’d hardly think he’d dare hang around,” Eve
said thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It just shows how badly he wants that treasure,”
Hattie May cried. “He’s willing to take any risk.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>“Wish I could think of a way to get my flashlight,”
Michael said, glancing toward the house. “I think I’ll
just have a try at those cellar windows on a chance,”
he added. “Be right back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They’re all nailed fast,” Eve called after him. But he
strode on.</p>

<p class='c010'>We sat down on the edge of the fountain. The statue
of Circe still lay where we had left it, reclining in the
leaf strewn bowl. Hattie May began poking with a stick
in the newly filled hole. Several minutes went by and
Michael did not return. “He must have got in after all,”
Eve said, glancing a little apprehensively I thought,
toward the thick growth of bushes that obscured our
view of the rear of the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>As she spoke our attention was caught by the sound
of a car coming up the hill. Automobiles passed that
way so seldom that we all jumped up instinctively. To
our surprise it appeared to be slowing down in front of
the house. Then suddenly I recognized Miss Blossom’s
little coupe and saw that lady’s ample bulk at the wheel.
A woman beside her was leaning over and peering out.</p>

<p class='c010'>I groaned as I looked. “Aunt Cal! If that isn’t just
our luck!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hattie May giggled. “Look, the fat lady is waving!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come on,” Eve started for the wall. “I’ll explain
everything satisfactorily to Aunt Cal.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>We climbed back over the wall. Miss Blossom beamed
upon us. “We’re out joy riding,” she explained. “I told
Cal she needed a little relaxation from her responsibilities.
We’ve been doing forty miles an hour before we
struck the hill!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We thought,” Aunt Cal remarked pointedly, “that
we might meet you coming home!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh,” I said confusedly, “we are—I mean we’re going
on directly—we’re just waiting for Michael.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Aunt Cal did not seem to be listening to my halting
excuses. Instead, I saw that her eyes—and her
thoughts with them, I guessed—had strayed beyond me
toward the house dreaming there in the soft sunset
light.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My, how sweet it smells!” exclaimed Miss Blossom.
“I wonder if those tea roses are still blooming? Do you
remember them, Cal? They were the sweetest ones I
ever knew! What d’you say we take a peek around?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Cal seemed to come back with a start. “Get out
if you wish, Rose,” she said. “I hardly think I care to
do so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, come on,” Miss Blossom urged. “Stretch your
legs a little.” She began, as she spoke, lowering her massive
bulk onto the running board. We gave her a hand
over the wall, though she was surprisingly agile for one
of her size. The tall grass fell away before her as at the
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>advance of a steam roller. “My,” she exclaimed, “what
a jungle!” She turned again, “Come on, Cal,” she
urged.</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Cal seemed to hesitate. And then I saw that she,
too, was getting out of the car. We came, all five of us,
back to the garden. Michael was still absent. Miss Blossom
sank panting on the edge of the fountain. “My
land! It’s just a crime to let a place run down like this!”
she commented. “’Member the time we went wading in
this fountain, Cal?”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Aunt Cal, if she remembered, did not say so. She
was standing erect, gazing about her. And it was not
so much sorrow at the sight of the neglect and decay
that I read in her face as regret for something that is
past and gone forever.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly Michael came advancing toward us.
“Hullo, there,” Miss Blossom called. “Is the house unlocked?
Could we go inside?”</p>

<p class='c010'>To my amazement Michael nodded. “Yes,” he said,
“it’s unlocked.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I thought you said,” Eve began and then stopped.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good!” said Miss Blossom. “Then we can take a
look around.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, no, Rose!” Aunt Cal spoke up sharply. “Not inside!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But why not?” returned the other matter-of-factly.
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>“If the agent’s so careless as to leave the place unlocked,
he couldn’t object to our going in. I’d just love to see
how the old place looks—I hear it’s just about as Carter
left it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It isn’t much to see,” Michael remarked. “Just a
musty old place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Michael Gilpatrick,” Miss Blossom demanded accusingly,
“is there some reason why you don’t want us
to go in. Out with it—what mischief have you been up
to?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael’s brown face reddened at the memory of last
Saturday night. “I only went after my flashlight,” he
said a trifle lamely. “I left it somewhere around——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Blossom jumped up spryly. “Well, anyway, I’m
going in,” she declared. “Come on, Cal, don’t be sentimental!”</p>

<p class='c010'>I got up too. I found myself suddenly sharing Miss
Blossom’s curiosity. Eve and Hattie May followed us
and, as we reached the door, I saw Aunt Cal and
Michael reluctantly bringing up the rear. Aunt Cal
wore a strange expression as if some inner force were
compelling her against her will.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Blossom pushed open the door and advanced
into the kitchen. “My,” she snorted, “what a stuffy
place! What this house needs is a good airing and”—she
glanced sharply around—“a good scrubbing with
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>strong soap and plenty of elbow grease. Look at that
range, Cal!”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Aunt Cal did not look at the range. She was
staring ahead at the open door and at the wide hall beyond
it. It was as if she expected to see someone advancing
out of the shadows.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Hattie May’s high-pitched voice broke in.
“Listen,” she said, “what’s that noise!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t hear anything,” I said. “And I guess you
don’t either, it’s just your imagination.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I did, I tell you. There! There it is again!”</p>

<p class='c010'>For an instant we all stood listening. And sure
enough, there was something, a gentle tapping noise
coming from far down the hall. “My land, the place is
haunted!” Miss Blossom giggled nervously. “Oh, girls,
I’m scared!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve looked at Michael. “Do you know what it is?”
she demanded.</p>

<p class='c010'>He shook his head. “No, but I think it’s time I found
out!” He walked toward the open hall door as he
spoke.</p>

<p class='c010'>To my amazement, Aunt Cal hurried after him. She
was just behind him as he put out his hand for the
handle of the parlor door. “Be careful, Cal!” Miss Blossom
called in a whisper. “I wouldn’t——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Cal paid no heed. And as Michael opened the
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>door she advanced with him across the threshold. From
where we stood in the middle of the hall we heard a
startled exclamation. Then suddenly, like a breath of
fresh air, came Michael’s clear ringing voice breaking
from surprise into laughter. “Hamish! What on
earth——?”</p>

<p class='c010'>We all crowded forward. In the middle of the shuttered
parlor stood Hamish, looking very much like a
small boy caught stealing jam. His face was flushed,
his shirt rumpled and I noticed a filigree of cobweb
clinging to his hair. “Just a little private investigating
I been doin’,” he offered the explanation sullenly as we
all clustered wonderingly about him. “But of course,”
he added petulantly, “I can’t get anywhere with a lot
of folks bustin’ in on me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hamish Lewis, what are you doing in this house?”
Hattie May demanded shrilly. “Look at your shirt and
that tear in your trousers!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish regarded his sister coldly. “All a girl thinks
about is clothes,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c010'>I was scarcely listening to this interchange. Ever since
I had entered the room I had been conscious of something
which had not been there before. This was a
curious odor, a heavy, sweet aromatic smell. A smell
which reminded me of the East and vaguely, too, of
something else, that awakened a hazy memory.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>“Mercy, what smells so funny!” Miss Blossom was
sniffing the air.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Guess you mean that jar that got spilled.” Hamish,
still with a highly injured air, pointed to where a small
bronze jar lay overturned in front of the fireplace. “I
moved that cabinet a little,” he added, “and that jar
fell out and spilled. It had that funny smelling stuff
inside.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Cal went over to where the jar lay and, stooping,
began gathering up the scattering of dried brown
particles and stuffing them back. “It’s the jar of myrrh,”
she murmured, “that Uncle Judd brought back from
Arabia.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was then that I suddenly found myself saying a
thing for which I was totally unable to account. The
words seemed to come out of themselves, almost as if
another person had spoken them. “The cabinet,” I
said, “doesn’t belong there anyway.” And I added
inconsequentially, “It’s right in the way of the cupboard.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Cupboard?” Eve looked at me strangely. And Hattie
May said, “I don’t see any cupboard. What on earth
are you talking about?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The cupboard there by the fireplace,” I insisted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sandy,” said Eve anxiously, “what’s the matter with
you? There isn’t any cupboard. You can see that.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span>“Yes there is,” I returned positively. “It’s where they
kept the china duck.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Of course they were all staring at me now as if they
thought I had become light-headed. “It’s very close in
here,” I heard Miss Blossom murmur. “Don’t any of
these windows open?” And Eve asked, “Do you feel all
right, Sandy?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Aunt Cal said a surprising thing. “I do seem
to recall a cupboard there at the right of the fireplace,”
she said slowly. “I had forgotten it entirely,” she looked
at me oddly. “I can’t think how you knew,” she added.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish, saying nothing, now walked over to the
fireplace and began feeling along the pink rosebud wallpaper
which edged it. Suddenly he began to tear at it.
“Sufferin’ sunfish! I b’lieve you’re right, Sandy! I believe
there is a cupboard there—see, there’s the edge of the
door! And me lookin’ in the chimney!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Looking for what?” Eve demanded. But Hamish
did not answer her. He was too busy tearing away strip
after strip of the rosebuds. We all gathered around to
watch. Nobody seemed to care at all that the wallpaper
was being ruined.</p>

<p class='c010'>As for me, my heart was beating strangely as the
outline of the cupboard came into view. Inch by inch
it was revealed. But how had I known?</p>

<p class='c010'>At last the paper was all off and we were gazing at
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>a good sized door set in the wall about four feet above
the floor. There was no handle or knob, that had evidently
been removed when the paper was put on. Hamish
took out his knife and thrust it into the keyhole.
“Locked,” he announced.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well don’t that just beat all!” Miss Blossom cried.
“How long do you calculate it’s been covered up, Cal?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Cal shook her head. “It must have been done
after Uncle Judd died,” she said. “I remember hearing
that Carter had some of the rooms papered before he
went away.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Blossom nodded. “Like as not the paper hanger
did it himself without consulting anybody. If it was
that Jed Button from Millport I wouldn’t put it past
him! I remember the time he did ma’s room——”</p>

<p class='c010'>But no one seemed to be listening to Miss Blossom.
We were all intent on watching Michael as he tinkered
with the lock. “Guess it’s no use botherin’ with it,”
Hamish remarked. “I guess it’s getting pretty late.” He
took out his watch.</p>

<p class='c010'>Michael looked at him suspiciously and went on
tinkering. Then suddenly Eve gave a gasp. “Why,”
she cried, “the key! Where’s the key? The one we found
in the tobacco tin?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why of course,” almost screamed Hattie May.
“Why didn’t we think of it before? Hamish, you’re
<span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>the one who took it! Where is it?” Then accusingly,
“You’ve been keeping it back on purpose, you wanted
to wait till we were gone!”</p>

<p class='c010'>To this accusation Hamish’s only answer was a shrug
and a sigh as he plunged his hand into his trousers’
pocket and drew out the key. With a grin Michael took
it and thrust it into the keyhole. There was a click and
Hattie May gave another scream. “It fits!” she cried.
“It fits!”</p>

<p class='c010'>But the lock was rusty and the key refused to turn.
“Needs oiling,” Michael remarked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s an oil can in my car,” Miss Blossom suggested.
“We’ve just got to get this cupboard open before
we go! Like as not we’ll find the family skeleton in it
or something!” she added with a laughing glance toward
Aunt Cal. Aunt Cal did not say a word.</p>
<div class='pbb'></div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>I don’t</span> know what I expected when I heard that
key turn in the lock and knew that Hamish had
at last succeeded in opening the door of the hidden
cupboard. I felt as I had ever since entering the room,
breathless and strangely excited. Of course Miss Rose’s
remark about the family skeleton had been just a joke.
I did not expect to hear the rattle of bones as the door
swung outward and see a cadaverous figure tumble onto
the floor. But still I did expect something.</p>

<p class='c010'>The door squeaked protestingly on its hinges as
Hamish pulled it wide. The room was utterly silent as
we all gazed blankly on three wide vacant shelves.
Empty!</p>

<p class='c010'>The silence was broken by a scream. It was Hattie
May again. “Look!” she cried. “It’s m-moving—the
bottom—look!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She was right. Slowly before our fascinated eyes, the
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>board which formed the base of the cupboard was
lifting like the lid of a box. Slowly from under it there
was emerging—not a bony grinning skull—but a face
of flesh and blood. A head, nearly bald and a lined,
leathery face in which little beady eyes gleamed with
mingled astonishment and fury.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish seemed to be the only one of us sufficiently in
possession of his senses to speak. “Well,” he said triumphantly,
“got you at last, didn’t I—you double-crossin’
rat!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then came Aunt Cal’s voice. “Gopher!” she cried,
her tone odd and uncontrolled.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man did not answer. He was engaged in raising
himself stiffly out of the hole. He was dressed in sailor
trousers and a sleeveless shirt. As the bottom of the
cupboard fell back into place he turned and glared at
Hamish. “So you’re the guy that’s been playin’ them
smart tricks!” he snarled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you mean locking you in the cellar,” Hamish returned,
“I figured you’d be some annoyed. But the next
time you peddle fake hair tonic——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a good tonic,” snapped the little man. “I made
it myself in Brazil from a native receipt.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yeah, but you had to get yourself a supply of wigs
to make folks fall for it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>This exchange of repartee was interrupted by Michael.
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>“Look here,” he demanded, “what are you hiding in
this house for? What are you after?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man turned on him sourly. “What business is
that of yourn?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s my business!” Aunt Cal’s voice had regained its
customary authority. She had dropped onto one of the
straight horsehair covered chairs and was regarding the
man with a strange tense look. “Where,” she demanded,
“is Carter Craven?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Bangs—for of course it was he—seemed to notice
her for the first time. And there was recognition in his
glance as he answered more respectfully than he had
yet spoken.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Craven’s gone. Died in the Argentine last winter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a moment’s silence and then Aunt Cal
asked tremulously, “You were with him when he
died?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The other nodded. “And that reminds me,” he said,
“he sent you a message, said I was to come back and
give it to you myself. Or if you wasn’t here to get your
address and mail it to you.” He began feeling in the
pocket of his trousers, presently bringing out a dog-eared
bill folder from which he extracted a dirty envelope.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And why have you not given me this before?” Aunt
Cal inquired as she took the letter from the man’s hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>He shrugged. “All in good time. I says to myself I’ll
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>just take a look round first and get the lay of the land
like.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish eyed him fiercely. “So you opened the letter,”
he accused “and took out the part you thought interesting—the
sheet that had those measurements on it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Bangs shook his head. “Naw, Mr. Detective, you
got me wrong. I never opened the letter. I found that
there paper—since you’re so interested—with Carter
Craven’s things after he died.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And that’s where you got the key to the house too,
I suppose,” Michael put in.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Right, Buddy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Anyway,” Hamish persisted, “you thought you were
going to dig up a neat little fortune out there in the
garden, didn’t you? Well, you jolly well got fooled!”
He turned to the cupboard and drew out the key. “If
you’d dug in the right place—which you didn’t ’cause
you were too stupid—that was all you’d have found.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mechanically the man’s clawlike fingers reached out
and took the key. His glance strayed from it to Michael’s
honest gray eyes. “Say,” he asked wonderingly, “is this
on the level?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s right,” Michael told him. “That’s all we
found.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose,” Hattie May spoke up pertly, “you expected
to dig up the blue emerald didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>“What’s that?” He turned and looked at her. “No,
sister,” he said slowly, “I had all I wanted of the Blue
Emerald!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What, you found it? You——”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man nodded grimly. “Yeah, sister, we found the
Blue Emerald—me and Carter together. It was there
just where the map said.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What map?” demanded Hamish.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Bangs shrugged. “Say, what is this?” he demanded
truculently. “A third degree or sunthin’?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Cal, still clutching the unopened envelope close
to her side, spoke again unexpectedly. “The Blue
Emerald was the gold mine I suppose, the one Carter
went to find after his father died?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Bangs nodded. “Yeah, he found the map among
the old man’s papers. He put all he had or could borrow
into her but”—he shrugged again—“he might as well
have thrown the money over the ship’s rail and it would
have saved us both a good sight of sufferin’.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A mine!” Hattie May said wonderingly. “The Blue
Emerald was the name of a gold mine! But—then—what
<i>were</i> you after? Why were you digging up the
garden?”</p>

<p class='c010'>For a minute it seemed as if he were not going to
answer. But Eve spoke up quietly, “You were measuring
the ground the very first day we came here.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>“Well what if I was?” he snapped. “I figured a man
don’t set down measurements on paper unless they mean
somethin’.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Carter’s mind was always running on buried treasure,”
Miss Blossom, seated comfortably on the old sofa
behind him, put in. “It was kind of an obsession as
you might say. I calculate he buried that key hoping to
fool somebody the way he’d been fooled so often.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But that doesn’t explain about the cupboard,” I cried.
“If it was just a—a joke, why did he have the cupboard
covered up?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Bangs honored me with a glance. Then turning
to the spot from which he had so recently emerged, he
lifted up the false bottom again and began fumbling
about below. At last he drew out a long dusty brown
envelope, tied with red cord. “Reckon that’s the answer,”
he said tossing it across to Aunt Cal. “Guess Carter
didn’t want that will to be found till he was good and
ready. He figured on comin’ back a rich man!” He
laughed hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If that wasn’t just like him!” Miss Blossom exclaimed.
“I always said he never destroyed that will!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Cal was untying the envelope with unsteady
fingers. Inside was a sealed one. “Yes,” she said, “it is
Uncle Judd’s will!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And Craven House is yours at last,” Miss Blossom
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>gave a vast sigh of satisfaction. “I always knew you’d
get it some day but I was afraid it might come too late
for you to enjoy it. Dear me, if these children hadn’t
found that key and all——”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hattie May, too excited to remember her manners,
burst in here. “But I don’t understand yet! I mean how
Mr. Bangs—or whatever his name is—how he happened
to come popping out just at the moment Hamish
opened the door? Why, it was exactly like a jack-in-the-box!”</p>

<p class='c010'>This characterization of his appearance in our midst
seemed to tickle Mr. Bangs for he grinned for the first
time. “Yeah,” he agreed, “reckon it did give you kind
of a surprise. I’d been a-poundin’ on that trap door for
quite a spell after this smart detective guy locked the
cellar door on me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hamish dotes on locking doors on people,” his sister
remarked. “It’s one of his pet tricks!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The cupboard must open into that underground passage
that Uncle Judd had walled up years ago,” Aunt
Cal remarked thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man nodded. “Yeah, I remembered hearin’ talk
of it. I poked around and found the entrance to it under
the cellar stairs, and this here ladder between the floors.
But it was dark as a ship’s hold down there and I
couldn’t get the trap door open. Then you opened the
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>cupboard and let in some light through the crack and
I see where she was hooked down. I reckoned I could
manage this smart guy here without much trouble—I
didn’t figure on runnin’ into a whole tea party!” he
finished with a cackle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose that was the passage you were hiding
in the night the cops searched the house for you?”
Michael remarked.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man shot him a sardonic glance but did not
answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Cal got up. “I really think, Rose,” she said, “we
should be starting for home. It’s growing dark and we’ve
had quite enough excitement for one day.” She turned
to the sailor and fixed him with a stern glance. “I
sincerely trust, Gopher,” she said, “that you will not
leave the neighborhood until I’ve had a further talk with
you. I—I naturally wish to hear more details of my
cousin’s last days.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man did not answer for a moment. But there
was an insistence in Aunt Cal’s tone that was not to be
disregarded. Perhaps he thought that, since the game
was up in any case, his best chance lay in compliance.
“Okay,” he said with another lift of his bony shoulders.
“I’ll hang round for a spell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As Miss Blossom’s little car rolled away down the
hill, no one spoke for a time. Eve and I were in the
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>rear seat. Hattie May had gone with Hamish in his
car. It was with some difficulty that we had succeeded
in prying the latter loose from the man whom he considered
his lawful prisoner. What was the use, he insisted,
of pulling off a capture if you had to turn the
fellow loose again?</p>

<p class='c010'>But Aunt Cal’s wishes of course had prevailed and
Hamish, still grumbling, had been obliged to depart
and leave the villain, as he dubbed him, to his own
devices.</p>

<p class='c010'>As we turned into the main highway at The Corners,
Miss Rose settled back. “Well, it does beat all,” she
said, “the mysterious ways Providence does work. To
think of that rascal Carter sealing up that old cupboard
with the will in it and going off to the ends of
the earth!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, Rose, not a rascal,” Aunt Cal returned, “you
mustn’t think of him like that. It was just a—a kind
of prank. He never meant to keep the house from me
for long, he says so in this note. You see I—I was away
out West at the time he left. I think it was just as
Gopher said, he wanted to come back a rich man——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And make you sorry you’d married Tom Poole instead
of him,” put in Miss Rose calmly. “That was just
like him, always believing that money was all that
counted even in a love affair.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span>“He says,” said Aunt Cal softly, “that he hopes I will
forgive him everything. I believe he realized—at the
end—the mistakes he’d made.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Rose nodded. “Yes, Carter wasn’t a bad fellow
at heart,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And Mr. Bangs?” Eve asked hesitantly, “you knew
him before, Aunt Cal?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes. His real name is Gopher—Harry Gopher.
He shipped as cook with Uncle Judd for years and used
often to be around town between voyages. Uncle always
said he was a rascal but he had a fondness for him
too. I shall have to see what can be done for him.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch26' class='c014'>XXVI<br /> <br />The Unveiling</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_6 c009'><span class='sc'>A month</span> had gone by. August was already drifting
into September. School loomed ahead but
we hardly gave it a thought. Each day as it
came along was too absorbing, for Eve and I agreed
that the business of making an old house come to life
again was about the most thrilling experience in the
world.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes, Aunt Cal had really moved into Craven House.
After much deliberation and lengthy conferences with
her lawyer, she had at last yielded to the combined
persuasion of Miss Blossom, Mrs. Viner, Eve and myself
and decided to give up the little cottage in Fishers
Haven and make the old place she had loved as a child
her permanent home. So the first of August had seen
us established. Painters, plumbers and paper hangers
had overrun the place. Miss Blossom had closed her
own house in the village for the time being in order to
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>help get things going. And from the day when she and
Aunt Cal had gone to work with broom and scrub
brush, all the latter’s doubts and misgivings seemed
magically to disappear. It was as if, with the vanquishing
of dust and cobwebs, something equally oppressive had
vanished from Aunt Cal’s mind. Her figure seemed
actually to grow more erect and her eyes to grow
brighter.</p>

<p class='c010'>Today we were waiting for Michael to come. He’d
formed the habit of stopping on his way down from
the farm. Sometimes it was his advice Aunt Cal wanted
about grading the lawn or the laying out of paths or
flowerbeds. Sometimes he was needed to bolster up the
flagging energies of our man of all work. For Gopher,
though freed of the charge hanging over him through
the intervention of Mr. Templeton and Captain Trout,
did not take kindly to the job with which Aunt Cal had
provided him. “Tillin’ the soil” he stated was out of
his line as, I strongly suspected, was labor of any sort.
But with Aunt Cal’s sharp eyes never long withdrawn
and the knowledge that but for her he would now be
sojourning in a far less pleasant place, he kept grimly
at it. I used to feel sorry for him sometimes as I saw
him stop to wipe his seamed, weatherbeaten face and
gaze sadly down the road. And some fine morning, I
felt sure, when the wind blew from the sea, Aunt Cal
<span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>would come out to give directions for the day’s work
and he just wouldn’t be there.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, here’s your letter at last!” Eve came up the
newly graveled path. She’d been to town with Miss
Rose to do some errands and get the mail. My heart
gave the little leap that it always does at the sight of
the thin paper envelope, bearing the Chinese stamp.
Aunt Cal came out to listen as I read it aloud:</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear daughter:</p>

<p class='c016'>Your account of your adventures at Craven House
gave us quite as much of a thrill as they must have
given you. I am immensely pleased that Calliope
has decided to move into the old place. I remember
it well. Your mother and I stopped there with you
when you were three years old, and your curious
recollection of the cupboard by the fireplace undoubtedly
dates from that visit.</p>

<p class='c016'>Your mother had come down for a last visit
with your grandmother Poole before we sailed for
the East. It was just after your Aunt Cal had married
and gone West to live. We stopped for a call
on Captain Judd Craven, a fine old man of the best
seafaring traditions. We were grieved to get the
news of his death the following year.</p>

<p class='c016'>I recall the big front parlor and the jar of some
sort of incense on the cabinet. Very likely you got
a good whiff of it, one that your sensitive nerves of
smell have never forgotten. The associative power
<span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span>of odors is well known, and so the cupboard and
particularly the china duck which you say it contained
became associated in your mind with the
strange new smell. Thus when you smelled it again,
even after the lapse of thirteen years, the particular
brain cells into which the memory had been packed
away released the recollection. I have heard of many
similar instances, but few which have led to so
dramatic a development as in your case.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, well, that does beat all!” exclaimed Aunt
Cal. “And to think of your being only three at the
time!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think it’s perfectly weird!” said Eve.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not weird at all,” I said. “Just perfectly normal and
scientific as Dad explains. And I must say I’m glad
to have it established that I’m not subject to trances
or—what was it—cataleptic fits as Hamish so darkly
hinted!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s Michael, and in a clean shirt too, if my eyes
do not deceive me! Let’s go tell him about it, he’ll be
frightfully interested.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hurriedly skimming through the rest of my letter—leaving
the real reading of it till bedtime—I followed
Eve across the yard. Aunt Cal went inside again to
superintend the cutting of the cake, leaving the big
front door wide open as it stood most of the time nowadays.
<span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span>This was against all the conventions of Old
Beecham, but Aunt Cal was too busy just now to give
much thought to the conventions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Today we had been working from early dawn,
getting ready for our first social event. It was to be—somewhat
to Aunt Cal’s dismay—a garden party.</p>

<p class='c010'>We found Michael standing in the middle of the
garden, surveying the arrangements. “Well,” inquired
Eve, “is your Majesty pleased?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He grinned at her. “Say,” he said, “am I going to be
the only man at this party?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, don’t worry. Captain Trout’s coming and perhaps
Mr. Templeton and Hattie May wrote that she
and Hamish would drive down if she could possibly
manage it. But listen to the explanation Sandy’s just had
of her vision the day we discovered the cupboard!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I object to having it called a vision!” I said. “It was
just a memory—coming out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When I had finished reading him what Father had
written, Michael said, “That’s mighty interesting! And
what a piece of luck that you happened to make that
visit here when you were a kid.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose it wouldn’t have mattered really,” I said.
“Aunt Cal has never told us just what Carter Craven
said in that note he sent her but I think he must have
told her where the will was, at least he gave her a clue.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>“Yes,” put in Eve, “but how do we know that
Gopher would ever have given her the note at all if
we hadn’t cornered him like a rat in a hole. Just like it
to slip his mind—he’s got about the slipperiest mind
I ever had the pleasure to deal with.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He hasn’t done so badly with this garden though,”
Michael observed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Would you ever have believed it could look so
lovely!” Eve asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. You can do most anything with land if you
put enough time and patience into it, providing of
course the soil’s fairly good. Next year, I hope it will
look even better.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the spring!” Eve said, her eyes shining a little.
“Oh, I do hope I shall see it in the spring when the
daffodils and tulips first come up!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I’ll probably be grubbing for exams about that
time!” Michael said. “But maybe I can get away for a
week-end. I’d like to see how those bulbs come up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And us and Circe?” Eve asked teasingly. “Shan’t you
want to see us?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope the frost next winter doesn’t crack that new
arm I made for her,” he answered, ignoring the question
and looking across to where, above the clean bowl
of the fountain, the restored statue stood, veiled today
in white cheesecloth.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span>Miss Rose drove up just then with Mrs. Viner and
we hurried out to greet our first guest. “My, how pretty
everything looks!” she murmured as we escorted her
to a seat. “Seems ’sif that golden glow there by the wall
sort of lights up the whole place! And how that larkspur
by the fountain has come on! What pride Emily
Craven used to take in her larkspur.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Next year,” remarked Aunt Cal, coming up, “I shall
have asters and mignonette in that bed too.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There comes a car up the hill,” I cried. “Maybe it’s
Hattie May and Hamish!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” Michael shook his head. “It’s Captain Trout in
Fishers Haven’s one and only taxicab.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Just behind came a string of other cars, bearing the
members of the Ladies Civic Betterment Society.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Rose in a large flowered muslin, which made her
look for all the world like a mammoth piece of upholstery,
moved among the guests, banishing all vestige
of stiffness with her good natured small talk and banter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bless my boots, what a transformation!” exclaimed
Captain Trout. “How delighted the old Cap’n would be
if he could see it!” he added, turning to Aunt Cal.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” she agreed simply, “I think he would approve
of what we have done.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How is Daisy June getting along?” I asked. “Do you
think she misses us any?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>“Well, now I can’t say that I’ve noticed her a-pinin’,”
he chuckled. “She’s still able to take a running jump at
my back when I ain’t looking.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Adam loves it here,” I said. “You ought to see him
walk down the hall, waving his tail, as if he were the
lost heir restored to his patrimony.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yeah, that’s like him—Caliph always did put on
airs!” The Captain chuckled at his own wit.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gopher dressed in his borrowed white trousers appeared
awkwardly carrying a tray. “Hi, Biscuits, what
you got here?” Captain Trout demanded.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sailor set down the cups of raspberry sherbet
with an apologetic grin. “Say, Skipper,” he whispered
hoarsely, “like to have me stir you up a batch of flapjacks
’fore you go?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no, certainly not!” Captain Trout took one of
the pink filled glasses and passed it to Mrs. Viner. He
helped himself to another.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last came the moment when the sun touched the
top of the fountain—the moment I had been waiting
for. At a nod from Aunt Cal, Michael disappeared into
the house. A moment later I got his signal from the
cellar window. Everybody stopped talking as I advanced
to the fountain and, reaching up, pulled the cord which
held the veil about the statue.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the same instant, Michael turned the tap in the
<span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span>cellar and the water gushed forth in a myriad sparkling
rainbow streams. Everybody clapped! It was exactly as
if the delicate figure of the Enchantress poised there had
really waved her wand and performed a miracle!</p>

<p class='c010'>A belated car came puffing up the hill, a green
roadster covered with dust. From the seat Hattie May
waved frantically. Eve flew down the path, I after her.
Hamish peered out at the group about the fountain.
“Say,” he demanded, “we ain’t too late for the refreshments
are we?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, indeed, there’s lots left,” I told him laughing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We had a blow-out of course,” Hattie May said as
she climbed out. “My how pretty everything looks!”</p>

<p class='c010'>As we came up the path Hamish caught sight of
Gopher collecting plates. “My aunt!” he exclaimed,
“Mean to say you let that fellow go round loose?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh,” giggled Eve. “he’s quite tame now really—just
like the garden. You’d be surprised!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Eve came out with a heaping tray. “Hasn’t anything
more queer been happenin’, I suppose?” Hamish inquired
hopefully between mouthfuls.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I’m afraid not,” I answered. “No more mysteries—except
of course what became of the china duck. And
I’m afraid that’ll never be solved.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hamish set down his empty plate regretfully. “By
the way,” he remarked, “I brought along a few little
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span>souvenirs I picked up on the way. They’re out in the
car.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“More gifts! Oh, Hamish!”</p>

<p class='c010'>After the other guests had departed Hamish distributed
his presents. There was a vanity case for Aunt
Cal whose countenance to date has been innocent of
make-up; shell-covered workboxes for Eve and me; a
combination pocket knife and can opener for Michael
and a huge heart-shaped box of chocolates for Miss
Rose.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, you cruel boy,” Miss Rose cried, “to tempt me
so!” She selected a plump one before passing the box.</p>

<p class='c010'>As Aunt Cal turned to walk with Mr. Templeton to
his car Hattie May whispered quite loudly, “I must say,
Sandy, that your aunt has changed. Why she’s like a
different person almost.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hush!” I warned, “It’s all Circe’s doing! Magic, you
know!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess more likely it’s two living Circes that have
done the trick,” said Miss Rose slyly, selecting another
chocolate.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, you mean you and—and Gopher?” Eve inquired
mischievously.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Rose giggled. “Fancy me on a fountain! No, it’s
a fact, Cal told me so herself, that she’d never have had
the gumption to go ahead with everything if it hadn’t
<span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>been for you girls. She said she wanted Sandra to have
a place to come to that she’d feel was a real home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Miss Rose,” I cried, “did she really say that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Aunt Cal came back down the path, Adam at her
heels. “Well now that that’s over,” she said, “we’ll
be able to settle down to normal living again! Michael
thinks I should put that south pasture into potatoes next
year. What do you think, Rose?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Farmer Gilpatrick advises!” Eve twinkled at him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well?” he inquired challengingly, “what’s the
matter with that? Suppose I should turn into a farmer,
what then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, then,” she returned, “you’ll buy a farm next
to ours—next to Craven House I mean—and make it
the very finest, most scientific, up-to-date farm in the
whole countryside.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, you might do worse,” Hamish remarked
solemnly. “I read the other day where a fellow was out
plowin’ up a field and what d’you s’pose he turned up?
An old gold piece, yes sir! And come to find out when
he dug down there was a whole lot of ’em buried where
some early settler fellow had hid ’em when the Indians
was comin’. What d’you think of that!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That settles it!” laughed Michael. “I shall become a
farmer.”</p>
